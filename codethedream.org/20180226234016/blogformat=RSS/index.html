<p>After a series of information sessions and a record number of interviews held, Code the Dream’s most diverse cohort yet has been selected:</p><ul><li>The cohort is split nearly 50 / 50 men and women.</li><li>Our high school applicants came to us from over a dozen schools across the region.</li><li>Students range in age from 14 - 59.</li><li>Students from immigrant families have roots in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Nigeria, among other places.</li></ul><p>Code the Dream students are hopeful to be the first in their families to attend college or to start their own business. They come from diverse backgrounds, including immigrant families and families trying to get back on their feet. They are hard workers who seek to give back to their communities in a greater way. Every student has unique story that we want to hear more of. As their cohort progresses, our hope is to be able to share bits of their stories with you every couple of weeks. Stay tuned!</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc/5a8c5cc9e2c483c408382035/1519333886740/1500w/CTD+info+session+%28Jan+2018%29+%281%29.jpg" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="773" height="570"><media:title type="plain">Code the Dream's Newest Cohort</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>More Applicants Than Ever Before!</title><dc:creator>Badria Mryyan</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2018/1/16/more-applicants-than-ever-before</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5a8c586724a6947bb639022a</guid><description><![CDATA[<img data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5a8c5baa71c10b0805e1f2bf/1519311320915/CTD+info+session2+%28Jan+2018%29.jpg" data-image-dimensions="863x428" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" alt="CTD info session2 (Jan 2018).jpg" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/5a8c5baa71c10b0805e1f2bf/1519311320915/CTD+info+session2+%28Jan+2018%29.jpg?format=1000w"  />

<p>For many Code the Dream students, the last step before they start getting paid to develop real apps is to take one of their own ideas and turn it into a fully functioning app. It's a big step requiring a lot of work, but on Saturday Crystal, Narayan, Rondale and Cristian were ready to demonstrate what they had created. Each of the the apps -- tentatively known as Bookish, Rating System, Just Married and Mini Facebook -- included features of widely used apps already on the market, but always with a twist. We look forward to seeing what these students will build in the coming months as they jump into their first real projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Fernando's family came to the United States, they settled in Johnston County. And there the opportunities were still limited, but Fernando pushed on and completed an associates degree at Johnston Community College. He still hadn't given up his dream of learning to code.</p><p>Two years ago, Fernando got an email about Code the Dream. He didn't think twice. He took the 12 week beginner course;&nbsp;then moved on to the intermediate course; and finally advance to making a much needed app for the nonprofit Student Action with Farmworkers (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.saf-unite.org/">SAF</a>).</p><p>Together with fellow CTD grad Jorge Rodriguez, Fernando developed an app called <a target="_blank" href="https://conectatecarolina.herokuapp.com/en">ConectateCarolina.org</a>&nbsp;to help migrant farmworkers find education, health and other resources nearby. For 10 months he worked hard on this app, taking into account feedback from SAF as well as from some of the farmworkers who now use the app.</p><p>Fernando believes learning to code has widened his interest in learning new things. He also believes it has made him more persistent. "For example, when I want to learn something new, coding has taught me to keep on pushing and finish what I want to learn." &nbsp;</p><p>This month Fernando is taking those skills and persistence to a new job as a software developer at Duke University.&nbsp;We are all proud of all the hard work Fernando has put in and all he has achieved as he embarks on his new career.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Javascript Class in Durham</title><dc:creator>Jocelyn Casanova</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 20:22:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/8/15/durham-javascript-class</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5993028b9f745648d6807e51</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Many people pack their bags and sunscreens ready to go on vacation.

Many immigrants and refugees who might lack the financial resources to pay for their education or support their families have benefited from his willingness to share his experiences and knowledge from working in the tech industry.</p><p>Cynthia Rios, a 16-year-old Garner High School student who became the youngest person accepted into program after applying at 14 years old, worked with Ruben Cruz, a 23-year-old Durham resident, to set up a computer site for the Kidznotes music program.&nbsp;</p><p>“I always wanted to find a way to program,” said Cruz, who was tipped off about the program while taking classes at Durham Technical Community College. “It’s really cool here. We have our mentors and we can talk to them about our ideas”</p><p>Daisy Howarth, a Ghanaian who came to the United States as a child, was a stay-at-home mom before she found Code the Dream. From those classes she received even more intensive training at the Iron Yard, a coding school that surprised many with its recent announcement that <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article162750093.html">campuses in Raleigh and Durham were closing.</a></p><p>Howarth, though, has been able to turn her experience into a job at a university in the area, and she has helped others from Code the Dream climb the industry ladder with her.</p><p>Fernando Osorto, 22, who came to this country from Honduras 12 years ago, is one of those people and was applauded on Saturday for landing a job with Howarth.</p><p>Osorto did not immediately set out to be a coder. After high school, he worked for a year as a framer before deciding he wanted to try something different.</p><p>After taking Code the Dream classes, Osorto worked with Jorge Rodriguez, who always has had a love for technology, on a project for the <a href="http://www.saf-unite.org/">Student Action with Farmworkers</a>.</p><p>The idea was to create a portal to help farmworkers, who are often immigrant laborers, find services they need in North Carolina. The site, which offers guidance in Spanish and English, helps farmworkers and their families find health care close to them, education opportunities, legal and immigration assistance, government agencies, housing and job information.</p><p>The two also are thinking about other kinds of apps they might try to create.</p><p>Rodriguez said his friends were thrilled with a Pinterest-style clone he made in several weeks.</p><p>“Coding was a little scary for me at the beginning,” Rodriguez said. “I’ve always been involved in technology. But for me, coming from Spanish and learning English, it’s like I know English, and now I’ve got to learn another language. ...Now I want to make apps that help the world, that help all people.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Students share their experiences at the Mexican Consulate education fair</title><dc:creator>Jocelyn Casanova</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2017 12:49:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/7/18/students-share-their-experiences-at-the-mexican-consulate-education-fair</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:596e810ad7bdceeadcd956b3</guid><description><![CDATA[<img class="thumb-image" data-image="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/59762ef537c581dd463c7fb0/1500917542206/" data-image-dimensions="2500x1875" data-image-focal-point="0.5,0.5" data-load="false" data-image-id="59762ef537c581dd463c7fb0" data-type="image" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29/t/59762ef537c581dd463c7fb0/1500917542206/?format=1000w" />

<p>On Saturday, the Mexican Consulate in Raleigh invited Code the Dream to present at its first ever 'education opportunity fair'.&nbsp;Students shared their experience with Code the Dream and explained a bit of what they had learned.&nbsp;Around 100 people came to their booth seeking for more information about possibly starting a career in tech. Students &nbsp;were also interviewed by the Spanish-language newspaper, Que Pasa.&nbsp;</p><p>CTD students really enjoyed talking to other peers who were in their same situation before they got started with Code the Dream. They're happy to be seen as an example and to provide any help they can.&nbsp;</p>]]></description></item><item><title>New beginner class in Durham</title><dc:creator>Jocelyn Casanova</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:23:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/5/23/new-summer-2017-course</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:59248b1245bf21aedac9d3cc</guid><description><![CDATA[<a class="image-slide-anchor content-fill"

<p>The annual <a href="http://www.thepowerofsharinggala.org/">Power of Sharing</a>&nbsp;awards gala was established to recognize the tremendous impact local nonprofits are making throughout our community. This year Code the Dream was honored to be invited and selected as the runner-up in the Education category, a wonderful recognition for our work. We are also grateful for the $5,000 award, which will allow us to provide an opportunity for more diverse students to hone their talents, gain experience while building apps that benefit our community and eventually achieve their goals of meaningful careers.</p><p>The Power of Sharing is hosted by the Coastal Credit Union Foundation and made possible by an impressive collaborative effort from AT&amp;T, BASF, BCBSNC, Capitol Broadcasting, Citrix, Lenovo, Duke Energy, IBM and the Triangle Business Journal. The event was a unique opportunity to come together with other nonprofits that serve low-income families across central North Carolina and be inspired by their work.&nbsp;Also, it isn’t often that we get to attend a ‘gala’, &nbsp;so that was fun too. Thank you to everyone who made the event possible!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Meet Jafet: Recent CTD grad and soon to be college freshman</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2017 14:40:15 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/5/9/meet-jafet-recent-ctd-grad-and-soon-to-be-college-freshman</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5911d4216b8f5bb99bd00fd2</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Jafet is a senior just a few days away from graduating from high school.

<p>This afternoon Jared Siirila was recognized during the 44th Annual Key Volunteer of the Year &amp; Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards Luncheon for volunteering with <a href="http://www.codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>.</p><p>Jared has served as an instructor for multiple Code the Dream classes, giving diverse low-income students the opportunity to take their first steps toward a successful career in technology. He also served as a mentor, guiding students through coding their first real apps for local nonprofits serving our community. Going above and beyond, he originally volunteered to assist 2 hours per day, 3 times a week with one 8-week class but has instead remained involved with nearly nonstop classes for the last 18 months.</p><p>This has allowed Code the Dream to grow and provide opportunities to more students than we could have without him. Although the technology sector is booming, that boom is leaving out many, especially low-income black and Latino youth. Jared is a great example of how people within the established technology sector can share their experience and help students make the leap all the way from low-wage jobs to developing their own apps and eventually building a fulfilling, innovative career.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Students Find Their Niche in Advanced Course</title><dc:creator>Grace Martien</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2017 20:24:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2017/3/7/students-find-their-niche-in-advance-course</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:58bf11473e00be1c14b9f37f</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>January marked the beginning of Code the Dream's Advanced Course in Durham. As students transition from basic programing to more in depth app development technologies, it's been inspiring to watch them also develop a keener sense that this could be a real future.</p><p>As Cait recently said, "CTD has been an awesome experience. Ever since beginning the course in October, I find myself looking at web apps and wondering who built them and what languages they used. I try to deconstruct things like user logins and think how I would tackle that part of a project."</p><p>Avi, who is still in high school, said he now plans to study computer science in college, and one day "start up my own business using the skills I have learned." Cait agreed that she was looking forward to "following a new career path that allows me to utilize these new skills.... I can't wait to see what's around the next corner!"</p><p>We can't wait to see it either.</p>

But last weekend we were happy to be back at the 'Kids Code' event at Marbles Kids Museum in Raleigh. The event uses fun, interactive techniques to give young children a chance to explore and experiment with technology and basic science and coding concepts.</span></p><p><span>Have you ever wondered how a computer can understand language -- how it really encodes data? Well, if you asked the hundreds of kids we saw on Saturday, they'd be able to tell you, more or less.</span></p><p><span>Code the Dream led an activity where each participant used colored beads (red and white) to make the first letter of their name using binary code. Binary code is how computers encode data by interpreting a pattern of 1's and 0's. With only a few beads falling on the floor, the museum began fill with children wearing binary bracelets, and a bit more insight and enthusiasm for the technology they use every day!</span></p><p><span>We want to say thank you to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marbleskidsmuseum.org/">Marbles Kids Museum</a> for the opportunity to share a bit of binary with the next generation of programmers! </span></p><p> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>New CTD class begins with extraordinary new students  </title><dc:creator>Grace Martien</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 19:33:28 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2016/11/10/new-ctd-class-begins-with-extraordinary-new-students</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5824c4593e00be0f71109e31</guid><description><![CDATA[<p><span>Today marks a month with our incredible new students from our class in Durham, NC.
