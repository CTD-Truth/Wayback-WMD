<p>For the past year, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Petra Holešínská, UNC graduate student and varsity basketball player hailing from the Czech Republic. Petra has been instrumental in helping us use our social media platforms to spotlight the amazing students and apprentices here at Code the Dream, as well as other important historical figures throughout US history that had a major impact on science and technology.</p>



<p>“My time at Code the Dream has been awesome. Everyone has been extremely helpful and welcoming from my first day here, which made the transition really easy. I got to improve my social media skills, while getting to know the people that make CTD so special. I want to thank Lori &amp; Justin for their support and guidance. This organization is truly amazing and I’m forever grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it.”</p>



<p>Petra is set to graduate this month with her Master’s degree in Educational Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship. Afterwards, she plans to continue pursuing a professional basketball career in the WNBA and overseas. We will miss working with Petra but couldn’t be more excited to see where her career takes her next!</p>

<p>Sintu moved to the United States with her family five years ago and didn’t have any real IT experience at that time. After volunteering in Atlanta, Georgia, she joined Code the Dream as a student before eventually becoming a front-end developer. Being new to coding, Sintu really appreciates how helpful has everyone been throughout this process: ‘’Code the Dream means collaborations and teamwork. All of the people here are very welcoming and helpful.  Working on different projects, you learn about the diversity and people’s backgrounds. I like that because so many different people can join.’’ She really enjoys working on real life projects because that’s something she didn’t get to experience before CTD: ‘’After I joined Code the Dream, it was real environment and real projects and I just knew that I wanted to be a software developer because I enjoyed working on real projects.’’ One of her favorite things about the organization is its diversity. Every day, she gets to work with diverse backgrounds: ‘’CTD is a place where everyone is accepted without any limitations. You get to work with many people and there is a lot of diversity. It is the right place for everyone no matter their background and without exclusions. I love this experience and I would recommend it to everyone.‘‘</p>

<p>Selamawit is originally from Ethiopia and she moved to the U.S. in 2018 after winning the diversity visa lottery. She has a background in civil engineering, but she also got the chance to learn coding during her bachelor’s study. After working as a cashier for over a year and receiving her Master’s degree in software development, she joined CTD in October 2020 for an internship. Her favorite thing about Code the Dream is the family atmosphere: ‘’For me, Code the Dream is family. We help each other, we share our experiences, since most of the people are from different countries. It feels like I’m somewhere with my family and friends. Everyone supports us whenever we need help or just have a question during coding. I love working with these people and I’m never scared to ask questions because everyone is so friendly. I just really like it.’’ Selamawit has always enjoyed volunteering and working with people with different backgrounds and Code the Dream gives her an opportunity to do that: ‘‘The people working here are from different countries, which creates multicultural environment and diversity of culture. I like that environment.’’</p>

<p>Martina and her husband moved to the U.S. from Serbia in 2018 to create a better future for their family. Having an experience in web design, Martina was looking for a job and an opportunity to grow as a developer. She found out about Code the Dream through UpwardlyGlobal, an organization that helps immigrants land their first job in a field they have their degree in. She decided to join, and is really happy about her decision: ‘‘This experience is unforgettable. From the first moment, I had a strong feeling that I was in the right place because of the people, who were guiding us through the program, the quality of the program itself, mentors, who are incredibly patient and supportive and really knowledgeable and because of really cool and friendly classmates.’’ She is currently developing her back-end skills while working on the VAMOS project with other developers. Martina’s favorite thing about CTD is its’s mission: ‘‘I like Code the Dream’s mission of helping underprivileged people to make their dream come true to become software developers by educating them, supporting them and giving them a chance to implement their knowledge in participating at the development of amazing apps and helping people in need. I like the opportunity they are giving people and that they are doing real projects that are actually helping people, while also helping other non-profit organizations.’’</p>

<h2>Cindy Mendes</h2>

<p>I was born and raised in France. In 2015, I moved to the states as an Au Pair. I started working with programming languages including Java, Python, HTML/CSS, and PHP while I was studying software development at Durham Technical College. I am fluent in French and Portuguese and I have been living in the Triangle since 2017. I love reading manga, fiction and crime novels. I also enjoy rock climbing, playing volleyball, biking, and spending time with my dog.</p>

<p> I was born and raised as a farmer in Taiwan, and have always been a patient and passionate learner. I enjoy picking up new knowledge and applying my new skills to help others in my community. I have been a school teacher, a barista, an animator, and am currently pivoting my career path to be a software developer. As a self-taught coder, I know how hard it could be to work without a team and not having a guideline. I have a tiny veggie farm and a small flock of chickens, and I love playing video games when I&#8217;m not wearing the framer/programmer hat. I have lived in the San Francisco Bay area for the almost 10 years that I&#8217;ve been in the US. I&#8217;m ready to join the amazing CTD family in action and hopefully in person (relocated to NC!) after the pandemic.</p>

<p> I moved to the US from Belarus in 2014 with my family due to my husband’s work and originally settled in California. In 2017, we moved to North Carolina and I’m so happy with that decision! All my life I’ve been working as an accountant and had zero coding experience before the Code the Dream course, but now I’m excited to start a new career path!&nbsp;When I’m not working/studying I like to spend time with my two daughters, I also like traveling, reading books (mostly Russian), playing the piano, and learning new languages.</p>

<p>At Code the Dream, we have a deep love of the community we&#8217;re building. It&#8217;s a community that is full of people with a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences who now come from all over the country. It celebrates immigrants and communities of color. It is a community that is changing the tech sector, one new hire at a time. And we&#8217;re excited to announce that, because of a new partnership, that community is getting a little bigger. </p>



<p>We&#8217;re joining with <a href="https://www.codetenderloin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Tenderloin</a>, a nonprofit with a similar mission to ours based out of San Francisco. They were founded in 2015 in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, which historically has had less access to economic opportunities than other parts of the city. Now, Code Tenderloin seeks to remove barriers to long-term employment, with a special focus on employment in the tech sector. CodeRamp, their tech-centered class, teaches JavaScript and aims to jumpstart the careers of future software developers. </p>



<p>We recognized immediately the values we share with Code Tenderloin and are thrilled to be partnering with them for our upcoming Web Development class. Code Tenderloin is supplying additional mentors for our class, and we&#8217;re working together to make sure Code Tenderloin students get support throughout the program. Through this partnership, we are able to grow our class to the largest it&#8217;s ever been — 54 students — without sacrificing any of the personal relationships our students form with their mentors. </p>



<p>As Code the Dream continues to grow, we are continually seeking out new partners like Code Tenderloin to make sure our work can have a greater impact. We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to see what&#8217;s in store. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="571" src="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-hats-1024x571.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5914" srcset="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-hats-1024x571.png 1024w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-hats-300x167.png 300w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-hats-768x428.png 768w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-hats-600x335.png 600w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/zoom-hats.png 1355w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The COVID-19 virus is one of the most challenging crises we’ve faced in generations. The direct pain caused by the virus and economic fallout from social distancing has upended the way we normally live. We are working hard to adapt to the circumstances, through the projects we work on, our online classes, and our team structures. These challenges have made us at Code the Dream (CTD) even more thankful for the incredible community that we’ve built, and we’re determined to do our part to give back.  </p>



<p><strong>Projects</strong> </p>



<p>CTD Labs was designed in part to build technology that works toward social good and benefits our communities. We’ve worked on several projects recently that help people respond to COVID-19. First, we collaborated with the Durham Public Schools Foundation to build an address-validated <a href="https://support-bullcityschools.netlify.app/">form </a>that allows families to sign up for food delivery. In the first weekend of this program, DPS sent more than 4,000 meals to families in Durham.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also built a website for <a href="http://www.facemaskwarriors.com">FaceMask Warriors</a>, a nationwide collaboration of more than 16,000 volunteers who are working to make up for the face mask shortage through homemade cloth and fabric masks. FaceMask Warriors was originally a collection of 50 separate state groups based on Facebook, but because of Code the Dream, they now have a central national hub for their work. </p>



<p><strong>Online Classes</strong></p>



<p>In 2019, we began offering our free coding classes online as part of a national expansion. Now, we’re grateful that we already had remote infrastructure in place, keeping our classes fully functioning during social distancing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, we announced a new partnership with <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, an online tech school that offers courses in computer programming.Code the Dream is now using Treehouse’s video content to implement our curriculum, while continuing to provide supplemental instruction and materials.&nbsp; This month, our Ruby on Rails students began work on Treehouse’s Rails track, and our interns are continuing to brush-up their skills using this great new resource!</p>



<p>In May, we’ll begin our next Web Development class. We’ve had nearly 400 applicants from 23 states, giving us the chance to continue making an impact on the national level. Having already conducted one class online, we are ready to dive into the next one!</p>



<p><strong>Code the Dream Team</strong></p>



<p>And as Code the Dream staff and interns, we are hopeful that we our transition to remote work may actually lead to becoming a stronger organization by the time this is over. As an increasing number of our interns are located outside of North Carolina, we’re working on ways to make our office culture accessible to everyone. We started a “CTD Daily Cafe”, in which all of our interns and staff are able to connect over lunch each day. Our weekly professional development “Huddles” are now entirely online, and our interns are stepping up and teaching each other about a wide range of programming topics. </p>



<p>We’re also having fun – a new #FunAndGames Slack channel (our team communication platform) gives us space to play random online games, and a weekly virtual happy hour means we can unwind together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. But we’re also learning how much we need each other. We’re being taught new ways to love and care for each other and our community. Our mission at CTD doesn’t change, and we’re going to keep working.<br></p>

<p>Recently at Code the Dream, we have been leaning in to doing more of our work online. In response to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Code the Dream&#8217;s staff has moved to working fully remote until it is safe to return to the office. We are fortunate that <a href="https://codethedream.org/wral-techwire-durhams-code-the-dream-goes-national-with-remote-classes/">we launched our national remote participation program last year</a> and have been able to make a quick transition. We&#8217;ve already had 100+ video conferences with students, interns, and staff – all collaborating to keep learning and building apps that help our communities. </p>



<p>Under current circumstances, with all the uncertainty, social distancing and overnight unemployment, we know this path to opportunity is more important than ever. We&#8217;re also preparing for our next class, which will be fully remote. Our transition to remote classes will help us continue to work through the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. It will also help us reach people outside the Triangle area of North Carolina. </p>



<p>In light of this full transition to remote classes, we&#8217;re excited to announce that Code the Dream will partner with <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, a national leader in online software development learning, to host most of the content for our upcoming class. Thanks to Treehouse, Code the Dream will have custom-built tracks and more robust ability to track the progress of our students.  Through this partnership, Code the Dream will take advantage of Treehouse&#8217;s extensive collection of professional videos and interactive content to give the best experience to our students.</p>



<p>This is an exciting development for our online classes and our overall ability to make Code the Dream available to more students. We are grateful to Treehouse and looking forward to broadening our collective impact by working together.</p>
