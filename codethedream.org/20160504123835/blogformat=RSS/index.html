<p>Teachers and RTP staff had to prod hundreds of students to get them out the doors, even with the fire alarm going off and the ceiling sprinklers spraying down a few yards away. Some say it all started when overzealous students began 'studying' frisbee flight a little too close to the sprinklers.&nbsp;But whatever the cause,&nbsp;when kids don't want to leave a science event, that's the sign that things were going pretty well!</p><p>The event was put on by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rtp.org/about-us/us2020/">US2020 RTP</a>, a mentorship-based program that aims to inspire young North Carolinians to pursue STEM careers. As a program that recognizes that minority and immigrant youth remain terribly underrepresented in these fields, Code the Dream was happy to be asked to participate.</p><p>Code the Dream Lead Instructor Ramiro Rodriguez brought in an Arduino, an open-source prototyping platform in order to give the kids a taste of how simple code can be used to interact with objects in the "real world." Our team was really impressed with the students' curiosity and desire to understand how things worked.</p><p>And the kids kept coming by the hundreds... right up until the alarm sounded,&nbsp;the sprinklers started spraying, and the lady by the elevators started yelling "This is not a drill!"</p>

<p>On Saturday an enthusiastic group of Code the Dream mentors and students gave up part of their weekend to inspire an even younger generation of future coders and innovators at the first ever Kids Code event at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marbleskidsmuseum.org/">Marbles Kids' Museum</a>.</p>

<p>Cynthia is only 14 herself but already a great student in our current Raleigh CTD class. So it was easy for her to convey to younger children a sense of how 'cool' coding can be and how quickly you can make progress from a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>Francisco noted that the kids who came for the Kids Code event were quite were more diverse than what we see in most tech companies today. One boy even told our students he had been trying out coding since he was 8!</p><p>Thanks so much to the Marbles staff for hosting such a great event. It's interesting to think that we may not see the full benefit of a day like this -- both for the kids and for our whole community -- for years to come. But it seems like a great investment!</p>

<p>Jorge moved to the U.S. from Costa Rica just before high school. He quickly settled in, learned English, and ended up taking AP classes and graduating near the top of his class. &nbsp;But he couldn't find any way that he could afford college.</p><p>Eventually Jorge got an entry level job with a local tech company, and in recent years his responsibilities have grown. Still, he did not have a role in software development, and he knew he had more to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>What Jorge really wanted to do was learn to code. And he took his first steps down that path with Code the Dream last year.</p><p><span>Now after being a star student, Jorge has become the first Code the Dream student to volunteer to take on a teaching role - providing one-on-one help to new students and even teaching entire lessons.</span></p><p><span>Even with all his other responsibilities, Jorge has made time each week to help other young people who were in the same position as he was just a few months earlier. And the students have been very appreciative. While he can't fall back on years of experience, the fact that he started learning so recently means that he knows exactly what they're going through - what's easy and exciting, but more importantly what's likely to be frustrating and confusing. That makes him a great teacher.</span></p><p>You've probably heard the old saying:&nbsp;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.</p><p>But what if that guy who just learned to fish then volunteers to teach others how to fish? Soon enough a whole community is eating a little better, which is pretty awesome. Thanks Jorge!</p>

<p>Beginning last week another talented group of Code the Dream students got to work learning the basics of computer programming. Like previous groups, the class includes young people from all over the world -- some born here in the United States, while others have come from Mexico, Pakistan, Nigeria and Guatemala.&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly half of our current class are women, something few tech companies can say, and something we're very proud of!</p><p>Any photos that look nice are most likely thanks to photographer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rwkmedia.com/">Ricky Leung</a>. The rest are from Code the Dream staff.</p>

<p>Students also got an opportunity usually reserved for corporate and other paying clients --&nbsp;to evaluate their own strengths with Raleigh Consulting's George Alwon and Francisco Chavez. It was great to have their expertise and to hear students working through their own goals and possible career paths.</p><p>But probably the most exciting part of the event was hearing more about some great projects that students have been working on -- both paid work that students have gotten since starting Code the Dream and projects they are working on just because they think it could make the world a little better place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A team of eight hardworking Code the Dream students and mentors spent over 20 hours last weekend developing an app to improve internet access for the visually impaired. Their efforts were part of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/triangle/startup-weekend/5951">Startup Weekend</a> event hosted at the <a target="_blank" href="http://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a> in Durham. The team's app, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theblankapp.com">The Blank App</a>, won the&nbsp;weekend-long competition sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="http://connectability.challengepost.com/">AT&amp;T</a> to develop the best app to&nbsp;improve the lives of people living with disabilities.</p><p>We're proud of the team for winning, but of course we're even more excited about the opportunity to make something that stands to improve people's lives.</p><p>A bit more information about our app, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theblankapp.com">The Blank App</a>:</p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-GHwqfXXx1c?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><h3>The Problem: Poor Web Accessibility for the Visually Impaired</h3><p>The internet, and all the information, tools and experiences it offers, should be a boon to the visually impaired. It has the potential to bring a hard-to-navigate world to our doorstep. But sadly, much of the internet itself remains very hard to navigate for those who can't see or see well. We need to make it easier to share where the problems are and fix them.</p><p>Visually impaired users are often frustrated by images with no descriptions or fields that cannot be read by their screen reader. Thereâs usually no easy way to lodge a complaint or to coordinate with others facing the same problem. Even on sites developed by conscientious coders following accessibility norms, itâs easy to miss problems. Hence the need for more feedback directly from visually impaired users.</p><h3>The Solution: Seamless Problem Logging and Automatic Fixes</h3><p>Our team of developers includes visually impaired members who use zoom text and screen readers tools every day. Our easily downloadable browser extensions (currently available for Chrome and Firefox) allow visually impaired users to use a single keyboard shortcut to automatically capture problem URLâs and log their feedback.</p><p>With the browser extension, users will also automatically upload fully accessible âfixedâ versions of sites commonly reported to have problems. Based on helpful feedback we've received from many of our first users, our team has a number of fixed sites currently in beta testing.</p><p>In addition to our in-house developed fixes, theblankapp.com will also share collected accessibility data and allow third-party developers to upload their own fixes for common issues â thereby creating a crowdsourcing platform to rapidly multiply the number of âfixedâ, fully accessible sites.</p><p>Beyond directly improving visually impaired users' experience, we believe the data we capture will be a valuable tool for sharing with policymakers and fostering a more inclusive society with fully equal access.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>CTD in &#x27;Que Pasa&#x27; Spanish newspaper</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 15:27:08 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2015/5/31/code-the-dream-in-que-pasa</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:556b1ba6e4b063c81eb44781</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Ofrecen cursos de programaciÃ³n y desarrollo de aplicaciones a jÃ³venes hispanos</strong></h2>

In what's known as the Research Triangle - an area that includes all three cities - the entrepreneurial ecosystem has become a laboratory working to address some of America's great challenges.</p><p>Racial and gender inclusion? We're working on it. A creative AND affordable quality of life?<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.forbes.com/places/nc/raleigh/">&nbsp;It's happening.</a>&nbsp;A common cause across generations? Without it, we wouldn't be here at all. It's not that the&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/lifestyle/which-is-americas-best-city-09202011.html">Research Triangle has the answers</a>. But a confluence of assets, people and ideas -- and a drive to succeed -- has put in place the tools to experiment.</p><p>When Steve Case brings his&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://riseofrest.com/">Rise of the Rest tour here on May 5</a>, he'll find not just startup founders standing in line to pitch their 'eureka' moments, but a community eager to share the business and cultural map we're drawing together. Here's a look at three key points on the map:</p><p><strong>Generations Joined:&nbsp;</strong>Much has been written about millennials' quest to find their footing. In the Research Triangle, many have embraced a regional legacy -- but added a new twist. Previous generations founded three world-caliber research universities here -- Duke, NC State, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill -- as well as the vast Research Triangle Park, home to pharma and tech giants from GSK to Red Hat and IBM.</p><p>To this tradition, 20 and 30 somethings contributed a crucial new layer: startup hubs and incubators, designed in part to retain the talent coming out of our universities and transform research into companies, jobs, opportunity. A symbiotic relationship soon took flight. For example, the&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a>&nbsp;-- a Google for Entrepreneurs tech hub and home to&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://americanunderground.com/">back-to-back Google Demo Day winners</a>&nbsp;-- features the support of all three universities and the governing body of the Research Triangle Park, which recently added its own entrepreneurial hub.</p><p>Here, generations frequently link arms, with quantifiable results. At the&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="https://americantobaccocampus.com/">American Tobacco Campus tech hub</a>&nbsp;-- developed through a partnership of longtime community pillars -- six young companies have made exits within the last 24 months amounting to&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://americanunderground.com/1-billion-6-exits-24-mos-durham-nc/">more than $1 billion</a>&nbsp;in stock and cash.</p><p><strong>Inclusive:&nbsp;</strong>America's demographics are fundamentally changing.&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/cspan/pop_proj/20121214_cspan_popproj.pdf">By the year 2043, the current minority population is forecast to be the majority population</a>. In the Triangle, we see a major opportunity building. We're working aggressively to build an inclusive ecosystem from the start, rather than repair deficiencies after it's built.</p><p>A program launched by Uniting NC,&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>, is teaching young members of our immigrant community the basics of Ruby on Rails to begin a pathway into some of the Triangle's high-paying developer jobs. Last month, the American Underground partnered with San Francisco-based CODE2040 and Google for Entrepreneurs to bring aboard an Entrepreneur in Residence, Talib Graves-Manns of&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://rainbowmekids.com/">RainbowMe</a>, to support minority led startups while building his own business.</p><p>At the front end, the team at the Durham Innovation District (which hosts Duke University researchers in downtown labs) recently donated $250,000 to a program identifying and training a diverse assortment of budding science and tech leaders before they hit high school. Further in the process,&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://soartriangle.co/">Soar Triangle</a>&nbsp;and e51 provide mentoring, access to capital networks, and more, with the goal of scaling more and better-funded female led teams in the Triangle.</p><p>By cultivating diverse leaders and technology companies, these businesses will have a fundamental advantage in serving a more diverse economy and world. That means new jobs and opportunities, which feed into our next big issue.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong>&nbsp;Increasingly, Americans long for both urban amenities and the opportunity for more people to share in them.&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.today.com/money/best-cheap-cities-raising-family-2D79535619">The cost of living in the Triangle is much lower</a>&nbsp;than in other tech metros. This natural advantage has become a key starting point for building a thriving and inclusive community that encourages creativity and enterprise.</p><p>New housing is popping up in city centers here at a healthy variety of price points. In downtown Raleigh, entrepreneurs can live in&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.thinkhouse.us/">ThinkHouse</a>, a 24/7 dorm for startups, and mix with people from every corner of the city at&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.sparkcon.com/">SPARKcon</a>, an annual, grassroots arts and innovation festival. In downtown Durham, you can live on a modest budget in the historic and revitalized&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://durhamnc.gov/ich/cb/cdd/Pages/ssd_revit.aspx">Southside</a>&nbsp;neighborhood and bike to three major tech hubs and a minor league baseball stadium.</p><p>All over, bike lanes and greenways are unfurling, often driven by the organized advocacy of young entrepreneurs. And while our public conversation about mass transit continues to be noisy, that's only because it includes a symphony of voices.</p><p>Do we have all the answers? Not even close. Are we asking the right questions? We think so. The Triangle is purposefully working to deal with the hard stuff we know and that which may come. Hard stuff is what entrepreneurialism is all about. It's about diligently working to create something better, just as the Rise of the Rest tour is doing.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Code the Dream featured in The Indy</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Apr 2015 23:43:55 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2015/4/17/code-the-dream-featured-in-the-indy</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:5531992fe4b05a690b399f74</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/a-durham-program-helps-immigrants-overcomeobstacles-to-learning-high-tech-skills/Content?oid=4371364">http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/a-durham-program-helps-immigrants-overcomeobstacles-to-learning-high-tech-skills/Content?oid=4371364</a></p><h1>Dreaming in Code</h1><p>By&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/ArticleArchives?author=4322401">Emily Feng</a></p><p><strong>E</strong>ach weekday, from 9 to 5, Ruben Cruz learns to code. Less than a year ago, Cruz, whose parents immigrated from Mexico, had no programming experience. Now a full-time student at The Iron Yard, an intensive coding academy in downtown Durham, he will graduate with the skill level of junior software developer.</p><p>Cruz credits Code the Dream, a program based in the American Underground, with his quick ascent. Spearheaded by Raleigh-based nonprofit United NC and American Underground, Code the Dream provides computer-programming classes to students of immigrant backgrounds who otherwise would not have the chance to learn coding.</p><p>Code the Dream originally began as the brainchild of Dan Rearick, the executive director of United NC, which works with immigrant communities in North Carolina to improve their opportunities.</p><p>Rearick is motivated by a strong belief that immigrants are integral to economic success. "First- and second-generation immigrants start their own businesses at twice the rate of native-born American citizens," he says. "And those numbers are probably artificially low because of other obstacles immigrants face. Imagine harnessing that drive and work ethic."</p><p>His path intersected with that of Adam Klein, chief strategist of American Underground. Klein had already been bouncing around ideas for channeling American Underground's formidable network of start-ups and entrepreneurs into a community project.</p><p>"We especially have a strong interest in providing a counter narrative to the homogenous culture in the tech industry in places like San Francisco," which, Klein says, employs disproportionately few minorities and women.</p><p>For example, nationally, just 1 percent of those who work in the tech industry are African American and just 2 percent are Hispanic.</p><p>Klein and Rearick identified lack of educational opportunity, particularly in immigrant communities, for this disparity. Together, they imagined Code the Dream as an educational program targeting potential programmers of immigrant backgrounds.</p><p>United NC called for applicants in early 2014. One of the students that responded was Cruz.</p><p>Code the Dream began with 12 students who participated in weekly classes in programming applications such as Ruby on Rails. While a few students left the class, many responded enthusiastically. "They did really feel like they had an opportunity they wouldn't have had otherwise, so they were equally motivated to learn as much as they could out of the experience," says Mason Matthews, a volunteer mentor.</p><p>"I feel like I'm networking more, which is very important," says Cruz, who was born in North Carolina. "I'm meeting people who have the same interests to me and who have connections to real businesses who will hire people like me."</p><p>Ramiro Rodriguez, a freelance software engineer and a volunteer instructor for Code the Dream, emigrated from Mexico as a child. He sees the role of mentors and providing professional networks as especially crucial when lowering the barriers of access in the tech industry. "Latino immigrants tend to come from lower socioeconomic status, and because of that they're just not exposed to what's possible," Rodriguez says. "They don't have good role models in terms of science and technology."</p><p>Keny Murillo, another former student of the program, hopes to pursue a career in medicine. Still, he sees his coding experience with Code the Dream as invaluable. "It at least gives students like me an opportunity when there are not that many opportunities available to us, without asking for this paperwork or that. That's something that is good to be a part of."</p><p>Â </p>]]></description></item><item><title>Our Raleigh class in pictures</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 03:03:54 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2015/3/24/our-raleigh-class-in-pictures</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:55122240e4b01593abae2d3d</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Smart&nbsp;hard-working students + top-notch instructors = a lot of learning in just 6&nbsp;weeks.</p>

<p>The one-month course is designed to take students from no experience to coding their first app. In addition, students have the chance to learn from mentors and meet entrepreneurs who have started their own businesses. The class is intended as a first step toward a career in tech or to provide students with the tech skills that will make them stronger applicants for jobs or studies in other fields.</p><p><strong><span>Who can apply?</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Code the Dream is open to young people 15 to 25-ish. We provide a gateway to the tech sector for people who might not otherwise have the opportunity, particularly minority and immigrant youth. But regardless of your background, we'd love to hear from you!

Out of the 12 who started in September, 10 successfully built their first app. They've provided online feedback on their experience:</p><ul><li>100% rated Code the Dream as "a great experience." In fact, half said it was "one of the best educational experiences I've ever had."</li><li>80% thought it could be a first step that could help them find a job in tech</li><li>All 100% wanted to continue with Code the Dream</li></ul><p>But it's not without challenges. Most participants are either working or taking community college classes, which means their advancement with Code the Dream comes at the expense of sleep or time with family. Nevertheless, our team of new coders expressed their determination to learn more, many in the hopes of finding a career in tech or to starting their own business.</p><p>As Code the Dream plans more beginner classes, our goal is to continue to support a growing cohort of coders who can continue learning through a combination of additional coursework, mentor relationships and real world projects. We recognize that bridge building, project management and entrepreneurial thinking are at least as important as learning the syntax of a new coding language. And we're all excited to keep building this effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Â </p>]]></description></item><item><title>Startup Dreams</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 03:14:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2014/11/5/startup-dreams</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:545a425ce4b09a5cc2e66791</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1415153231368_140210">This weekend a team from Code the Dream was invited to participate in <a target="_blank" data-cke-saved-href="http://startupweekend.org/" href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> in Raleigh. The original idea was that we -- Jorge, Ruben, Marcel, Keny, Ramiro and I -- would just go to help out on other startup ideas. But after a little cajoling, Keny pitched an idea for an app to help immigrant students find the college that was the best fit for them. And it proved to be one of the most popular ideas pitched on the first night. So a team was formed, and a long weekend of brainstorming, coding, debugging, and presenting began.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1415153231368_140673">After the final presentations, voting began for the crowd choice award, and we could all see the tally come in on a bar chart projected in front of the room. When the voting was done, Code the Dream's startup had came in second out of the 12 final pitches, by one vote! And that's when Keny told us he'd voted for the other team. What? Well, according to Keny, "You can't vote for your own idea, right?" And so it was, that the team got a strong second place finish and a good story that Keny will not live down for quite a while.</p><p><br></p>]]></description></item><item><title>One month later, we've coded our first apps!</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2014 02:22:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2014/11/4/one-month-later-weve-coded-our-first-apps</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:545986bbe4b09a5cc2e4da3f</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>We reached a first milestone -- successfully coding our own fully functioning, attractive, web deployed apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we started a month ago, nobody from our first Code the Dream class had ever coded even the simplest app. In fact, most of us had never even written our first line of code. But after a lot of hard work and the help of an amazing team of mentors, we've got apps!</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
