<p>We believe that Black Lives Matter. <br><br>The killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police last month — along with the earlier murders of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery — has highlighted the violence and systemic racism that Black people face on a daily basis in America. We are encouraged by the calls for justice that have sprung up across the nation, and recognize the decades-long work by activists that has allowed this moment to happen. <br><br>We know that the tech industry has failed to adequately address racism within the industry. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001gbMYHX7ew3VG59C-P7eDZaa_n_EhbrUXK-Xd4FpqUMxbkEIDua7xUeziTtSCiYtIkKzMEjenG26vLwdQjLZGGSsDUUIdcWqE8M1pVcWeHFrTSYusefHfYYCbbPXYF_qy2ffThghirY4_1mlaFyq7X9U5Ftlq_BIMlMVGq3MWaP32d3DC4lo-BEo6sqs8Y5rTipJpZRYPgfKogPObUNKKIwO30kOADMTJFW4MqbcobmU=&amp;c=e_1-SK2vFXzdZe9fALGGxRT9iinJjwYHIsCZ0LBTdXXb6QlF8q1zoQ==&amp;ch=vF_OqSOdCvqKrork0ykA09ZJF7tVcRScY9DfeXraA0C1zApcwnqLuQ==" target="_blank">Less than 5% of hires at major tech companies are Black</a>, social media companies <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001gbMYHX7ew3VG59C-P7eDZaa_n_EhbrUXK-Xd4FpqUMxbkEIDua7xUeziTtSCiYtI_iGy7mcFRA7EyLtbIhdi60wahvzUJnPt5vrvwsDNmwu2EgLxEzw0xzojmUOJeMJAEWYkfDQ6Nlq1Y8JgFD6Hu93996f8_BoXI7fRcylrB1MQDXhohTDJs-qO5UQQyb53-T_UIxDBKejyDGcyQUsEfgzEP29K_HFneAWuAhK0rcQeDLSN-508uQ==&amp;c=e_1-SK2vFXzdZe9fALGGxRT9iinJjwYHIsCZ0LBTdXXb6QlF8q1zoQ==&amp;ch=vF_OqSOdCvqKrork0ykA09ZJF7tVcRScY9DfeXraA0C1zApcwnqLuQ==" target="_blank">have turned a blind eye</a> to racism on their platforms, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001gbMYHX7ew3VG59C-P7eDZaa_n_EhbrUXK-Xd4FpqUMxbkEIDua7xUeziTtSCiYtIPCCfBwR38EixjFx7TecgRPqGMjOD-vcEYy31nFTM2L1xh1LwCeOPTeGLvFdO1nFbPztwaXXVNU2LR3YD5bFNBHfsUVxOAegUyKC15fVW4b2cpwEQ29DmbZckjbHNrLPkowPrpgy-CXrV1GmIpg5mbe4xOFAGp_O61W8-T-qdiRvNhf0hBfDlIxNo-yr3eIXK&amp;c=e_1-SK2vFXzdZe9fALGGxRT9iinJjwYHIsCZ0LBTdXXb6QlF8q1zoQ==&amp;ch=vF_OqSOdCvqKrork0ykA09ZJF7tVcRScY9DfeXraA0C1zApcwnqLuQ==" target="_blank">technologies like artificial intelligence</a> have been imbued with our own biases. It’s clear that a statement isn’t enough — tech companies and organizations like Code the Dream must do more to combat racism in our industry and in our nation. <br><br>Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, we are having broader conversations about how Code the Dream can work towards racial justice. This is a time to reflect on the wrongs of the past (and present), as well as our hopes for the future. <br><br>Ensuring that people of color have equal access to opportunity is what Code the Dream is all about &#8212; ensuring that Black and Brown lives have all paths open to them, and that our ideas are equally valued and made manifest, including in the technologies we build.<br><br>Equal opportunity is only part of the solution — we need to build technology that works towards justice.

Led by NC Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, NC Fair Chance helps give people a chance to clear their name, find better housing, and get better jobs. <br><br>NC Fair Chance is just the beginning of the anti-racist technology that we hope to build. We know that the work of justice is ongoing, and we commit to continuing this work. We hope you’ll join us in this continuing effort.<br><br>We hope you have a reflective, energizing, and happy Juneteenth! </p>

<p>At Code the Dream, we have a deep love of the community we&#8217;re building. It&#8217;s a community that is full of people with a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences who now come from all over the country. It celebrates immigrants and communities of color. It is a community that is changing the tech sector, one new hire at a time. And we&#8217;re excited to announce that, because of a new partnership, that community is getting a little bigger. </p>



<p>We&#8217;re joining with <a href="https://www.codetenderloin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Tenderloin</a>, a nonprofit with a similar mission to ours based out of San Francisco. They were founded in 2015 in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco, which historically has had less access to economic opportunities than other parts of the city. Now, Code Tenderloin seeks to remove barriers to long-term employment, with a special focus on employment in the tech sector. CodeRamp, their tech-centered class, teaches JavaScript and aims to jumpstart the careers of future software developers. </p>



<p>We recognized immediately the values we share with Code Tenderloin and are thrilled to be partnering with them for our upcoming Web Development class. Code Tenderloin is supplying additional mentors for our class, and we&#8217;re working together to make sure Code Tenderloin students get support throughout the program. Through this partnership, we are able to grow our class to the largest it&#8217;s ever been — 54 students — without sacrificing any of the personal relationships our students form with their mentors. </p>



<p>As Code the Dream continues to grow, we are continually seeking out new partners like Code Tenderloin to make sure our work can have a greater impact. We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to see what&#8217;s in store. </p>

<p>The COVID-19 virus is one of the most challenging crises we’ve faced in generations. The direct pain caused by the virus and economic fallout from social distancing has upended the way we normally live. We are working hard to adapt to the circumstances, through the projects we work on, our online classes, and our team structures. These challenges have made us at Code the Dream (CTD) even more thankful for the incredible community that we’ve built, and we’re determined to do our part to give back.  </p>



<p><strong>Projects</strong> </p>



<p>CTD Labs was designed in part to build technology that works toward social good and benefits our communities. We’ve worked on several projects recently that help people respond to COVID-19. First, we collaborated with the Durham Public Schools Foundation to build an address-validated <a href="https://support-bullcityschools.netlify.app/">form </a>that allows families to sign up for food delivery. In the first weekend of this program, DPS sent more than 4,000 meals to families in Durham.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also built a website for <a href="http://www.facemaskwarriors.com">FaceMask Warriors</a>, a nationwide collaboration of more than 16,000 volunteers who are working to make up for the face mask shortage through homemade cloth and fabric masks. FaceMask Warriors was originally a collection of 50 separate state groups based on Facebook, but because of Code the Dream, they now have a central national hub for their work. </p>



<p><strong>Online Classes</strong></p>



<p>In 2019, we began offering our free coding classes online as part of a national expansion. Now, we’re grateful that we already had remote infrastructure in place, keeping our classes fully functioning during social distancing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, we announced a new partnership with <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, an online tech school that offers courses in computer programming.Code the Dream is now using Treehouse’s video content to implement our curriculum, while continuing to provide supplemental instruction and materials.&nbsp; This month, our Ruby on Rails students began work on Treehouse’s Rails track, and our interns are continuing to brush-up their skills using this great new resource!</p>



<p>In May, we’ll begin our next Web Development class. We’ve had nearly 400 applicants from 23 states, giving us the chance to continue making an impact on the national level. Having already conducted one class online, we are ready to dive into the next one!</p>



<p><strong>Code the Dream Team</strong></p>



<p>And as Code the Dream staff and interns, we are hopeful that we our transition to remote work may actually lead to becoming a stronger organization by the time this is over. As an increasing number of our interns are located outside of North Carolina, we’re working on ways to make our office culture accessible to everyone. We started a “CTD Daily Cafe”, in which all of our interns and staff are able to connect over lunch each day. Our weekly professional development “Huddles” are now entirely online, and our interns are stepping up and teaching each other about a wide range of programming topics. </p>



<p>We’re also having fun – a new #FunAndGames Slack channel (our team communication platform) gives us space to play random online games, and a weekly virtual happy hour means we can unwind together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. But we’re also learning how much we need each other. We’re being taught new ways to love and care for each other and our community. Our mission at CTD doesn’t change, and we’re going to keep working.<br></p>

<p>Recently at Code the Dream, we have been leaning in to doing more of our work online. In response to the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Code the Dream&#8217;s staff has moved to working fully remote until it is safe to return to the office. We are fortunate that <a href="https://www.codethedream.org/wral-techwire-durhams-code-the-dream-goes-national-with-remote-classes/">we launched our national remote participation program last year</a> and have been able to make a quick transition. We&#8217;ve already had 100+ video conferences with students, interns, and staff – all collaborating to keep learning and building apps that help our communities. </p>



<p>Under current circumstances, with all the uncertainty, social distancing and overnight unemployment, we know this path to opportunity is more important than ever. We&#8217;re also preparing for our next class, which will be fully remote. Our transition to remote classes will help us continue to work through the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. It will also help us reach people outside the Triangle area of North Carolina. </p>



<p>In light of this full transition to remote classes, we&#8217;re excited to announce that Code the Dream will partner with <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, a national leader in online software development learning, to host most of the content for our upcoming class. Thanks to Treehouse, Code the Dream will have custom-built tracks and more robust ability to track the progress of our students.  Through this partnership, Code the Dream will take advantage of Treehouse&#8217;s extensive collection of professional videos and interactive content to give the best experience to our students.</p>



<p>This is an exciting development for our online classes and our overall ability to make Code the Dream available to more students. We are grateful to Treehouse and looking forward to broadening our collective impact by working together.</p>



<p>As we prepare for our next 2020 classes, we&#8217;re confident that Code the Dream, with our classes powered by Treehouse, can continue to prepare and equip the next generation of diverse, highly skilled programmers. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tony Byrd was growing increasingly discontented with his job running the coffee shop in the lobby of IBM’s main building in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. He had been working there since he graduated from high school nearly a decade ago, and with two young kids to provide for at home, Byrd, 27, was itching for a new start.</p>



<p>Now you can find him buying coffee from the same bar he used to run, except this time as a full-time IBM employee.</p>



<p>Byrd’s transition from barista to IT worker is part of what has become increasingly necessary in today’s technology industry: companies looking to nontraditional places to fill a growing talent gap.</p>



<p>Byrd is a recent graduate of IBM’s apprenticeship program — a 12-month-long training program for workers without advanced degrees, where he learned coding languages like JavaScript, Python and C#. It’s a win-win for Byrd and IBM. He has the chance to start a career in the tech industry and receive a big raise from his barista days. And IBM has gained an employee who says he’s in no hurry to leave Big Blue.</p>



<p>“It meant a lot and took a weight off my shoulders,” Byrd said of being hired full time. When asked whether it made him feel a sense of loyalty to the company, he said it did.</p>



<p>IBM’s apprenticeship program was pioneered at its RTP office in 2017. Since then, the program has spread to several IBM offices. In two years, it has led to nearly 200 employees being taught how to code, run cybersecurity and a host of other skills. Around 90% of people in the program have become full-time IBM employees, the company said.</p>



<p>Kelli Jordan, director of career and skills at IBM, said the program was born of necessity, with hundreds of thousands of IT job openings around the country going unfilled.</p>



<p>“Every company is becoming a tech company in some sort of way. … It is a bit of a numbers game,” she said. “There’s over 700,000 (unfilled) tech jobs, and when you look at candidates that are coming out of the traditional pipeline, there are only about 70,000 with a computer science degree. Those numbers don’t match up.”</p>



<p>So IBM came to the realization it had to recruit differently.</p>



<p>“That meant looking at community colleges and coding boot camps,” she said, rather than just depending on the universities producing enough computer science graduates.</p>



<p>The apprenticeship model — where potential workers get paid while they learn new skills — has been around for a long time, mainly in the trades. IBM says it’s one of the first tech companies to try the model. In the IBM program, apprentices receive 200 hours of learning on average, both in the classroom and in real-life projects, applying new skills and getting real-time feedback.</p>



<p>Jordan said she has received loads of calls from other companies about how to set up a similar program.</p>



<p>Advertising</p>



<p>IBM isn’t the only local tech company looking for ways to recruit employees from nontraditional places. And with more than 28,000 IT job postings in North Carolina in December — a 10.8% increase from the year prior, according to the N.C. Tech Association — there are plenty of options for the most qualified workers, forcing companies to focus on retention and mining new talent.</p>



<p>A survey of Raleigh-area chief information officers by the recruitment firm Robert Half found that 46% of them were willing to be more flexible on skills requirements and provide training to new hires.</p>



<p>Companies like Lenovo have created internship pipelines at local community colleges, giving opportunities to dozens of students every year. Fidelity is now funding a scholarship at Wake Technical Community College for students studying cloud storage and cybersecurity to chip away at the local talent gap in those fields. In the past year, SAS Institute has made it easier for autistic workers to find opportunities at its company. And Credit Suisse has launched an initiative at its RTP office to help train workers — many of them women — who have been out of the workforce for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>“It was created to target an overlooked talent pool of qualified candidates,” Sophia Wajnert, head of Credit Suisse Raleigh, said of the program in an interview with The News &amp; Observer last year. “We realized there were talented individuals who struggle to return to work after a career break.”</p>



<p>As an added benefit, tech companies could also increase their workforce diversity by hiring from nontraditional sources of talent. North Carolina, as a state, lags behind much of the country when it comes to diversity in the tech industry, despite it being one of the more diverse states.</p>



<p>“For us, it definitely has helped with diversity,” IBM’s Jordan said. “We do see candidates who may have not been able to go to a traditional college but have been able to build skills.”</p>



<p>Dan Rearick, executive director of Code the Dream, a nonprofit that focuses on teaching immigrant youths how to code, said his coding boot camp was founded on the premise that tech companies would be willing to hire workers without bachelor’s degrees. A lot of the organization’s students did well in school, he said, but because they were Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, or “Dreamers”) many skipped college because they didn’t qualify for in-state tuition.</p>



<p>“Employers are, for the most part, very willing to consider people who don’t have a traditional background, or a computer science degree,” Rearick said. But he has found that most need to land a long-term internship at a company before they will be hired.</p>



<p>Fernando Osorto, 25, who immigrated to North Carolina from Honduras, worked in carpentry before he enrolled at Code the Dream, learning coding languages like Ruby on Rails. He now works at Duke University as a web application developer.</p>



<p>In his view, more companies should take a chance on coding boot camp graduates because they spend as much time learning code as many students in traditional schools. Yet, when he was applying for jobs after graduating, he thinks his resume was often passed over because he didn’t have a four-year degree.</p>



<p>It wasn’t until he proved his capabilities in an internship at Duke that he got a full-time gig.</p>



<p>“A lot of the jobs I applied to in their qualifications they would say you need a bachelor’s in computer science,” he said. “So even though I had the experience … . I think that was the reason I didn’t get a call back.”</p>



<p>If more companies looked beyond people with four-year computer science degrees, Osorto said, “I think it would greatly impact the outcome of the diversity in the tech world.”</p>

<p>Our Ruby on Rails students are back at work learning CSS and HTML in the second phase of their class, which focuses on web basics. We wrote about this class back in the fall –&nbsp;it&#8217;s our first remote-only class and has students from across the United States. I caught up with two of our students, Danielle Madry and Daniela Monti, and asked them about their experience so far. </p>



<h4>Danielle Madry</h4>



<p><em>Tell me about yourself!</em> I am from Kinston, North Carolina. I am a 29-year-old stay-at-home mom who loves to learn, spend time with my tribe, and create projects with my new-found programming skills. I am a Renaissance woman – I know a little about everything. It usually works in my favor, but sometimes it leaves work unfinished. But it is still a part of me that I embrace fully. </p>



<p><em>What are you most proud of during the Ruby on Rails course so far?</em> Staying consistent and not giving up when life and learning got tough.</p>



<p><em>What do you think makes Code the Dream unique?</em> Code The Dream provides a secure and solid future into tech through learning not only for me, but for generations of other learners that are in need.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>What podcasts have you been listening to recently?</em> I have been loving Code Newbies and Breaking into Startups.</p>



<p><em>Who is your hero?</em> My mother is my hero because I have seen her go through so much and never give up. She always finds a way to make it work. She would literally have nothing and somehow, someway find a way to make sure we were good. I aspire to resilient like her.</p>



<h4>Daniela Monti</h4>



<p><em>Tell me about yourself!</em> I am from&nbsp;Long Island,&nbsp;NY. I currently work at a non-profit that supports adults with disabilities. It was not something I ever expected to be doing, but I have grown a lot in the five years that I have been here. In my free time, I enjoy reading, doing photography, hand lettering, working out, and being outside (especially at the beach!).&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>What do you think makes Code the Dream unique?</em> I love that Code the Dream is FREE, but still offers guidance and a curriculum. It would have been very difficult for me to spend the time and money going back to school, so I wanted to learn to program in a less traditional manner. There&nbsp;are plenty of “free” ways to learn programming without schooling, but then you don’t necessarily have the accountability or guidance, which I knew I would need. I also love that we work in small groups with a mentor who works in the industry. I am not only learning how to code, but I am also so making professional connections which I hope will make finding a job in the future much easier.</p>



<p><em>What food is overrated?</em> Bacon is overrated. And why is it in EVERYTHING?</p>



<p><em>What&#8217;s something that surprises people about you?</em> People are definitely surprised to learn I went to a professional wrestling school for three years (and it was how I met my boyfriend!). </p>



<p><em>Who is your hero?</em> It may be a bit cliché to say that my parents are my heroes, but now that I am older I don’t know how they did all that they did for my siblings and me while we were growing up. Especially as a new homeowner, I can’t fathom how my mom found the time and energy to do all that she did (home-cooked meals <em>every</em>&nbsp;night!). My Dad has also been a volunteer firefighter for the past 30+ years. &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was two days to launch day, and we had just decided on some last-minute improvements to the app. We had only recently finalized its name. <a href="https://www.codethedream.org/mariposa-ar/">Mariposa AR</a>, as we decided to call it, was one of the most unique projects we had done yet, and the coming launch day brought waves of excitement and trepidation over the Code the Dream office. Thought up as a partnership between Code the Dream and the <a href="https://ncartmuseum.org/">North Carolina Museum of Art</a> and commissioned by <a href="https://fiber.google.com/?utm_expid=.ELF1DbWeTiuApFupIebq5w.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Ffiber.google.com%2F">Google Fiber</a>, Mariposa AR is an augmented reality app that allows users to virtually experience the museum&#8217;s Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera exhibits through two murals in downtown Durham. </p>



<p>The design process hinged on one simple idea: let people experience the Frida Kahlo and Diego River exhibits even when they were no longer at the North Carolina Museum of Art. To do this, the app would use augmented reality to open a &#8220;portal&#8221; to the exhibit and allow users to virtually walk around inside. Code the Dream had never made an AR app before, but we jumped at the chance to something this cool. </p>



<p>Now, though, I was worried. The developers –&nbsp;Irene, Jorge, and Tom –&nbsp;were working through the long weekend to make sure that it was ready, and I was drafting a social media plan for launch day while mentally running through all the ways the app could break. Sometimes the portals spawned too high for the user to reach, or so low they would have to crawl to get through to the museum. Sometimes parts of the AR experience didn&#8217;t load, and the app seemed to have issues on older phones. But launch day was coming, whether we were ready or not. </p>



<p>On the morning of launch day, I woke up early to walk downtown and do some last-minute tests of the app. It was bitterly cold; January had finally arrived in Durham. </p>



<p>The murals, located on E. Chapel Hill Street, were painted by Cecilia Lueza and Cornelio Campos and inspired by Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera&#8217;s works. Lueza&#8217;s &#8220;I Am My Own Muse,&#8221; in particular, always held my attention. I remember the first time I saw it –&nbsp;the vibrant colors caught my eye, and something about the way that Kahlo looks confidently upward filled me with hope. I was enthralled immediately. </p>



<p>But standing in front of the murals the frigid morning of Mariposa AR&#8217;s launch, I felt intimidated. My co-worker Crystal was having trouble getting the portals to appear, and the app seemed to have trouble with older phones. We trudged back to the CTD office at American Underground, where a few staff were planning out the day. </p>



<p>By 9:00, more CTD staff and interns were arriving at American Underground. We discovered that Mariposa AR works when the image of the Frida murals is projected and not just at the site of the murals, so we soon had the murals projected on the wall of the AU&#8217;s Bullpen as a growing throng of people wielding smartphones ducked around each other to get to the portals popping up on their screens. For a moment we thought about holding the event inside the AU to keep everyone out of the cold, but it was not as powerful when the murals projected rather than towering over you on the walls of the Durham Convention Center. </p>



<p>We bundled up and shuffled back out into the cold, the clump of us that walked the short distance from the AU to the murals resembling a group of excited school kids more than professional tech startup employees. </p>



<p>At the murals, we did some final testing of the app and waited for our partners to arrive. While I was waiting, I looked through the migration stories section of Mariposa AR, which asks users to input their family story and displays that story in a butterfly icon on a map of the world. The range of voices found in the stories is fascinating; one person writes of their family&#8217;s long history in Cary, NC, while another&#8217;s story is profound in its simplicity: &#8220;Swam rivers and crossed borders to get here.&#8221; </p>



<p>As the partners arrived, my phone buzzed continually with notifications from social media as more people started to talk about the app. The stars of the show were Irene and Jorge. They took partners on tour of the app and spoke with local media outlets who wanted to do pieces on the app (see their stories <a href="https://abc11.com/5870480/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.wraltechwire.com/2020/01/22/durhams-frida-kahlo-murals-come-to-life-with-new-augmented-reality-app/">here</a>, and <a href="https://grepbeat.com/2020/01/23/new-ar-app-brings-two-downtown-durham-murals-to-life/">here</a>). Lori, our Director of Partnerships, even started pulling random people off the street to try out the app. Soon, there was a crowd of people around the murals, drawing even more attention from passers-by as people hopped around each other to find the portals, swapped phones, and took screenshots of the art in the museum. </p>



<p>As I looked around the group, I saw the immediate impact of Mariposa AR.  Code the Dream staff and interns were mingling with media and the people who had stopped by to try the app, sharing our story with people who had never heard of us before. Dan and Lori were talking with someone from the City of Durham about more collaboration opportunities. People were finding new ways to engage with art. Downtown Durham was more dynamic as a result of the app, promising unique ways for people to be a part of their city. And perhaps most importantly, immigrants and their stories were being celebrated, both by the app and by the media, who noted that both Irene and Jorge came to the United States from Mexico. </p>



<p>I took one last journey to the artificial reality exhibit before heading back to the AU. Someone excitedly pointed out that virtual butterflies were gathering around &#8220;Juchari Ziranhua/Nuestros Raices/Our Roots,&#8221; representing the kaleidoscope of stories that each person in Durham brings to the city. </p>



<p>Mariposa AR&#8217;s launch day reminded us of our connections to art, to our city, and to each other. I&#8217;ll call it a success. </p>

<p>DURHAM, N.C. (WTVD) &#8212; We&#8217;re 20 miles away but murals in downtown Durham are your portal to the North Carolina Museum of Art.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can walk in and it&#8217;ll take you to the exhibition at the N.C. Museum of Art,&#8221; said Irene Serrano, Code the Dream.</p>



<p>Code the Dream exposes under represented groups to the world of computer coding-completely for free.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been both frustrating but then once we got it figured out it&#8217;s like yes, we&#8217;re one of the first ones to figure this one out,&#8221; Serrano said.</p>



<p>The two murals on East Chapel Hill Street in Durham pay homage to the Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo exhibit at the North Carolin Museum of Art. And with the Mariposa AR app created by Irene and Code the Dream, people can take a look inside through this augmented reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really great because we&#8217;re wanting to increase accessibility and just conveying the idea that the museum is really for everybody across the whole state not just for folks who are used to going to it in Raleigh,&#8221; said Angela Lombardi, NC Museum of Art.</p>



<p>You can also learn about the artists and stories of immigration, which is a theme of the mural represented by the butterflies &#8211; creating a community.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just all a way to connect people together in ways that have all been just thought of before but not done yet so it&#8217;s very exciting,&#8221; Serrano said.</p>



<p>If you want to download the app, you can take a picture of the QR code at the mural or visit&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.codethedream.org/" target="_blank">codethedream.org</a>.</p>
