<p>Code the Dream is excited to welcome a new class of programming students. This cohort is unique because it is enrolled in our first online-only class. Because of this, we are able to expand our reach beyond the Triangle, enrolling students from a number of states and four different time zones!</p>



<p>Our new students come from a diverse range of ages and backgrounds:</p>



<ul><li>Our cohort is comprised of 24 women and 18 men.</li><li>Over half are immigrants, with students who have come to the U.S. from Korea, the Dominican Republic, Nigeria, and Khazakstan, among many other countries.</li><li>Almost half of our students are from the Triangle; students are also joining us from other parts of North Carolina, California, New York, and the Midwest.</li><li>The cohort ranges in age from 16 to 49, although the average age is 30.</li></ul>



<p>Many of our students are parents, some are first-generation college students, and others are looking for a fresh start in their career. Each one brings a unique set of skills and experiences to Code the Dream, and we can&#8217;t wait to share more of their stories as the class gets underway.</p>

<h4><strong>Nick Santiago</strong></h4>
<h4><strong><a href="http://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_4421.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-3716" src="http://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_4421-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" srcset="https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_4421-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_4421-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_4421-600x800.jpg 600w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_4421.jpg 1409w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Tell me about yourself.  </em>I was born and raised in Rochester, NY. My family is of Puerto Rican descent.</li>
<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far?</em> Code the Dream has treated me better than I could have expected up to this point. I’m in tune with CTD&#8217;s mission and goal. I believe prioritizing the people is what makes CTD a unique organization to produce talent in this fast-growing industry.</li>
<li><em>What projects are you working on right now? </em>At this time, I’m working on my portfolio and we started a second project in which my partner and I are collaborating ideas for a music app. We shall see how it turns out.</li>
<li><em>What is your dream job? </em>What I want is to make something out of myself, but to achieve that, I believe I need to surround myself with people in this group and people or are better than me so I can pick up talent. If you really want to know a “dream job” then it would be to reach out to people who are less fortunate than me. How do I accomplish that? Only time would tell.</li>
<li><em>What music have you been listening to recently? </em>I’ve listened repeatedly to “Welcome to this Party” by Dave East feat. King Shooter. I’m a huge fan of sub-genre gangsta rap. It gives me hype.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a href="http://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190920_100629-1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3717 alignright" src="http://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190920_100629-1-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="159" height="200" srcset="https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190920_100629-1-238x300.jpg 238w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190920_100629-1-768x968.jpg 768w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190920_100629-1-812x1024.jpg 812w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190920_100629-1-600x756.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px" /></a></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Tell me about yourself.</em> I was born in North Carolina and then taken to China as a baby for 4 years before then coming back to the US. My parents settled in Virginia for a while, so I stayed there for 4 years. From there my family moved to North Carolina because we had bought a new restaurant. We moved to Durham because my family said: &#8220;It&#8217;s a big city.&#8221; Indeed, it was – and is –  a very booming city.</li>
<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far?</em>  My experience at Code the Dream has been great. CTD has been my first full-time job and my official first step into an IT career. The environment at CTD as an intern is very nurturing and community-oriented. It has taught me a great deal about what the professional world can be, instead of as cutthroat as I have read. There aren&#8217;t many programs like CTD. It teaches every immigrant, stay at home mom, or person interested in tech that their dreams are possible.</li>
<li><em>What projects are you working on right now? </em>Since starting at Code the Dream we have been working on several projects, including a tic-tac-toe board, a calculator, a profile page, and several more. These projects will allow me to be able to show future employers an example of my ability in react.js. I have been astounded by how far I have come. As a small-town immigrant child, I thought my only options were going into tons of debt in order to break into a career as a doctor or lawyer after years of studying, but now I&#8217;m taking my first steps into the IT world at 20, which would not be possible without CTD. This has been all very adventurous and shows how much can be accomplished in so little time.</li>
<li><em>What is your dream job? </em>My dream job used to be a pharmacist or a makeup creator who creates the makeup or a social worker, but seeing how much I can do in code has definitely swayed me a little towards the tech field.</li>
<li><em>Now for a hot-button issue. Does pineapple belong on pizza? </em>ALWAYS.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><em>Tell me about yourself.  </em>I grew up in Northern Virginia but moved to the Raleigh area over ten years ago.  My hobbies include playing with my ferrets, crafting, and graphic design.</li>
<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far? </em>My experience at CTD so far has been amazing!  Learning skills in a classroom could never teach as they are at the forefront of what the industry is currently doing. CTD is unique because of the great people it brings together.  You can’t get better diversity (and subsequently a better variety of creative ideas as a result) anywhere.</li>
<li><em>What projects are you working on right now? </em>All my current projects are React-based app building. Apps I’ve built or are building include a calculator, tic tac toe game, team picker to divide participants into teams randomly, and a music library/streaming app.</li>
<li><em>What is your dream job? </em>I’m still learning so my dream job may change but currently, I’d love to work for ReverbNation which is a Raleigh area site that helps manage and promote local musicians through their site.</li>
<li><em>What music have you been listening to recently? </em>A group called The Head and The Heart is what I’ve been listening to a lot lately.</li>

<ul>
<li><em><em>Tell me about yourself. </em></em>My family is from El Salvador, <span style="font-size: inherit;">a beautiful country in Central America. They migrated to Los Angles in the late &#8217;80s. I was</span><span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: inherit;"> born</span><span style="font-size: inherit;"> in Los Angeles and moved to Durham at the age of four, where I have been ever since. My hobbies are fishing, some cooking, and spending time with my family.</span></li>
<li><em><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far? </em></em>My experience has been awesome so far. I have made new friends and mentors through the program, and have also learned new programming languages that I’m excited to continue learning.</li>
<li><em><em>What projects are you working on right now? </em></em>I&#8217;m currently working on a personal portfolio page with mini projects, a team project app (Learning React.js), and extending my javascript knowledge.</li>
<li><em><em>What is your dream job? </em></em>My dream job is to be part of a great team that will help me keep developing my skills.  I want to give back to the community by helping kids learn about programming and technology<span class="Apple-converted-space" style="font-size: inherit;"> </span><span style="font-size: inherit;">and opening their minds to a new world of possibilities, as CTD has done for me.</span></li>
<li><em>Duke or UNC? </em>Blue Devils all day!</li>
</ul>
<h4>William Lopez</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Tell me about yourself. </em>I&#8217;m originally from Ocotepeque, Honduras but have lived in Durham since I was around five years old. I love playing soccer, even though I don&#8217;t play as much as I would want. I recently have gotten into coding, which can be more of a love/hate thing, but I truly do enjoy it!</li>
<li><em>How has your experience with Code the Dream been so far? </em>My experience at Code the Dream so far has been absolutely great. Everyone at CTD is extremely nice and just cool to talk to!</li>
<li><em>What projects are you working on right now? </em>We just finished up a group project building board game. So far I&#8217;ve learned some CSS, a little bit of fire base and how it works, and some other things as well.</li>
<li><em>What is your dream job? </em>I want to work in a friendly environment where people are eager to help you with the problems you are having.</li>
<li><em>Duke or UNC? </em>DUKE!!! All day!</li>

<p><em><strong>This story was written for WRAL TechWire Advisor partner&nbsp;<a href="http://momentum-landing-techwire.pagedemo.co/?utm_source=TechWire&amp;utm_medium=Digital&amp;utm_campaign=C-AWBB&amp;utm_product=PT-NSCO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Momentum Learning</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>A lot of companies talk about investing in their employees, creating a more diverse work environment, and growing the workforce, but too many times these are just bullet points in a company handbook. That’s not the case for Raleigh-based software company Pendo, which is working to deliver on those promises.</p>
<p>“Pendo is full of people with unique backgrounds and perspectives, and we are always looking for ways to add to that diversity,” said Leslie Neitzel, vice president of people at Pendo. “As we set hiring plans for the year, we identified some roles in our organization where we could create opportunities for people from underrepresented backgrounds just coming into the workforce.”</p>
<p>Neitzel, who serves as the head of HR, added, “It is important for us to reflect the places in which we live and serve.”</p>
<p>This year Pendo piloted its first student sponsorship to Momentum Learning, a coding school in Durham, complete with a job offer for the student upon the successful completion of Momentum’s program. Pendo and Momentum are no strangers to collaboration as they have previously partnered for events like tech trainings and seminars.</p>
<p>Neitzel said the scholarship is a platform that gives someone from an underrepresented community an opportunity to pursue a career path they may not have considered otherwise.</p>
<p>This year’s lucky scholarship recipient is 23-year-old Jocelyn Casanova, who will join Pendo as a technical success engineer after her cohort wraps up.</p>
<p>Casanova, as a woman and a Latina, represents something that is often missing in the dev industry, the presence of females and minorities alike. It’s estimated that less than 20 percent of tech jobs are held by women. Additionally, there are half as many Hispanics and African Americans in tech compared to the rest of the private sector.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been a person that has a passion for creating — I love making things, whether it’s through art or something else. To me, coding is like a form of art. It’s also complicated and abstract and takes on a different meaning from different angles for different people,” Casanova said. “Coding is something that I can take with me anywhere — it’s a universal language.”</p>
<p>The application of a coding education across several industries and even borders is not lost on Casanova.</p>
<p>Though ambitious and intelligent, Casanova’s post-high school journey has not been easy. After graduating from high school with honors, a personal situation made her ineligible for in-state tuition, throwing a wrench in her university plans. Unable to afford the cost of out-of-state tuition, Casanova enrolled at Wake Technical Community College part-time while simultaneously working several jobs to pay her way through. But the cycle of missing school for work and starting class again only to find herself financially overwhelmed never seemed to let up.</p>
<p>Around that time, her mother saw an ad for Code the Dream, an organization that offers computer programming classes to people from low-income and diverse backgrounds, and encouraged her to look into it.</p>
<p>Casanova learned Ruby on Rails (a coding framework) and was hired to work on staff at Code the Dream. Juggling the course work and multiple jobs again proved to be challenging and Casanova wasn’t able to complete the entire program. However, Code the Dream heard about the Pendo scholarship opportunity at Momentum and encouraged her to apply.</p>
<p>“Jocelyn was like many of our students; she was an amazing high school student and was very involved, made great grades … but she couldn’t get federal financial aid [for college]. Students like Jocelyn are a big part of why we started Code the Dream in the first place,” said Dan Rearick, executive director of Code the Dream. “She did our initial classes and did well, but she wasn’t able to keep going and complete our entire program. In some ways, it’s all the more wonderful that she’s been able to get this opportunity with Momentum.”</p>
<p>Rearick said Casanova lit up the room every time she was in class and calls her an “amazing people person.” Her affability will be an asset, as successful developers tend to work well with others, building strong teams that foster collaboration and the exchange of ideas.</p>
<p>Even though Casanova is fortunate to have a full-time job lined up already after she finishes Momentum’s program, she’s putting pressure on herself to succeed.</p>
<p>“Pendo is the reason why I’m here, and I need to make sure that I am representing them well; and not just them, but myself and my family,” she said. “I’ve gone through lots of ups and downs being an immigrant, and I’m just trying to be an inspiration for my little sister.”</p>
<p>For right now, Momentum’s program will be Casanova’s full-time job before she starts at Pendo and she’s absorbing as much as she can, as fast as she can. She said she is “sleeping, breathing and thinking about coding” all day.</p>
<p>“I’m doing everything I can, making friends and trying to understand the concepts — I’m happy that I’m able to learn and be here,” said Casanova, who frequently took the opportunity to communicate how grateful she is to be at Momentum. She mentioned the rigorous nature of the program and the adjustment period she had to go through, but said a positive mindset makes all the difference.</p>
<p>After being selected from a group of scholarship applicants, Casanova’s optimism and perseverance came through in her interview with the Pendo team. In addition to the diversity component, Neitzel said Pendo was looking for someone who was curious, interested in technology and passionate about serving customers. Neitzel said the team was impressed by Casanova’s passion and her desire to “leave the world a better place than she found it.”</p>
<p>“She has a very strong work ethic,” Neitzel said. Diligence is a trait all Momentum students must have in order to get through the courses. “We’ve hired previous Momentum graduates who have been successful here at Pendo. We know this program prepares its graduates for both the skill requirements and demands of today’s tech jobs.”</p>
<p>Neitzel emphasized the Pendo-sponsored Momentum scholarship is just one step in the company’s effort to continue to build an inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled that someone like Joceyln has the opportunity to contribute to that,” Neitzel said. “Our culture is not something that is defined by HR or even the leadership team. Our employees are the co-creators of our culture. When you continue to bring diversity into an arena, you become a better reflection of society.”</p>
<p>You can see Casanova and her classmates present their final projects at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/momentum-demo-day-summer-2019-tickets-64745543664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Momentum’s upcoming Demo Day</a>. The event is on Aug. 15 from 6 until 8 p.m. at American Underground’s campus on Main Street in downtown Durham.</p>

<p>Irene knows firsthand about life as a migrant farmworker. And now she&#8217;s working with colleagues Daniel and Andrea on a new mobile app to make sure farmworkers get the help they need to stay safe and healthy. Last month they used the app with <a href="https://episcopalfarmworkerministry.org/">EFwM</a> to coordinate outreach to farmworker camps in eastern North Carolina.</p>
<p>As Irene said:</p>
<p><em><strong>I spent the first four years in this country living with my family of 5 in single, tiny rooms, moving from one work camp to another. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Farmworkers need access to basic health care, labor law information, wage fairness, safety, housing, clothing. This app allows the outreach process to flow smoothly, maximizing the use of limited time and resources. </strong></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>Having grown up in a farmworker family, I have experienced firsthand the impact that things as simple as not having the right safety equipment when working can have in someone’s life. I witnessed firsthand many of the issues surrounding farmworkers like people getting injured at work for not having some basic safety tool, or people passing out from heat exhaustion because they are having to wear a lot of clothes as prevention for toxic materials they are exposed to everyday.</strong></em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>Seeing farmworkers getting the resources they need through the use of an app that I&#8217;ve helped develop is perhaps one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. </strong></em></p>

<p>Tilneil Gary is one of the new interns that has joined our Code the Dream team. Here is some information about Tilneil and her experience with Code the Dream.</p>



<h4><strong>Tell us about yourself.</strong></h4>



<p>I am from a very small town called Enfield located in Halifax County, NC and now reside in Raleigh. Currently, I am working as a Program Consultant for a state-wide public health teen pregnancy prevention program.</p>



<h4><strong>How did you hear about CTD?</strong></h4>



<p>I saw a TV segment on WRAL featuring Daisy Magnus-Aryitey, the Director of Code the Dream.&nbsp; I went online and filled out an interest form.  Months later, I received an email inviting me to attend an interest meeting and to apply to the Ruby on Rails Course.</p>



<h4><strong>How has your experience been with CTD?</strong></h4>



<p>My experience has been great. It has been a challenging but rewarding experience. I would compare this to learning a new spoken language. It takes the same level of regular studying and practice. The class instructors, mentors and CTD staff have been great, they&#8217;re very supportive and dedicated.</p>



<h4><strong>What skills have you learned?</strong></h4>



<p>During the first cohort of Ruby on Rails, we were introduced to the Ruby Programming Language.  Over the months, we learned to build web applications using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Rails. With a new understanding of programming, I&#8217;m excited about all the possible applications I can help create.</p>



<h4><strong>What do you think makes CTD unique?</strong></h4>



<p>I would say that Code the Dream is unique in&nbsp;its&nbsp;partnerships with local government and community-based non-profit organizations; and the obvious fact is that the entire program is free. You only have to commit your time and enthusiasm in wanting to learn something new. Code the Dream&#8217;s involvement in the public sector was another reason I was very interested in participating in the program.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What is your dream job?</strong></h4>



<p>Currently, I would say my dream job would be able to work with other public health, education, social services or human rights advocacy groups to develop applications to educate or provide resources to the general public. However, I would welcome any opportunities for me to further practice and develop my programming skills. I enjoy expressing my creativity. I hope to one day make the applications I imagine a reality.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p><strong><em>Tell me about yourself. </em></strong></p>



<p>My name is Lennda Chen and I am from Durham, NC. I recently graduated from Durham Technical Community&nbsp;College in December of 2018 with an Associates in Arts.</p>



<p><strong><em>How did you hear about CTD?</em></strong></p>



<p>I heard about Code the Dream through one of the programs I am involved in called Partners for Youth Opportunity.</p>



<p><strong><em>How has your experience been with CTD? What skills have you learned?</em></strong></p>



<p>My experience with Code the Dream has been super pleasant. The people there are super helpful and it&#8217;s never about what you know, but if you are willing to learn with them.&nbsp;I have learned Javascript. While learning code is important, the life experiences I have gotten from CTD don&#8217;t even match up. From CTD I met Michelle, who is a mother of several kids. We are working on a project together called Tony, and we are learning a ton by doing it.</p>



<p><strong><em>What do you think makes CTD unique?</em></strong></p>



<p>CTD is unique because they provide tutors and mentors that support us in learning about tech and also life.</p>



<p><strong><em>What kind of jobs are you looking for or what is your dream job?</em></strong></p>



<p>In August, CTD labs will start and from there I will be really excited to bridge the gap between my interest in social interaction, coding, and societal equity plans.</p>

<p> Jonathan Payares is a current student in our JavaScript course!  You can read more about him and his experience at Code the Dream below. </p>



<p><strong><em>Tell me about yourself. </em></strong></p>



<p>My name is Jonathan Payares, I&#8217;m from Colombia (Cartegena), and  I&#8217;m currently working as a manager at Noodles and Company. </p>



<p><strong><em>How did you hear about CTD?</em></strong></p>



<p>I heard about Code the Dream (CTD) from Wake Tech Community College and one of my friends who attended CTD convinced me to apply. </p>



<p><strong><em>How has your experience been with CTD? What skills have you learned?</em></strong></p>



<p>My experience with CTD has been amazing! I really enjoy meeting like-minded people who are interested in growing themselves. The instructors have been very helpful by encouraging me to learn. At the moment I have learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and it has pushed me to look into different frameworks like node.js and reactjs.</p>



<p><strong><em>What do you think makes CTD unique?</em></strong></p>



<p> I think what makes CTD unique is their willingness and determination to see you grow as a coder.</p>



<p><strong><em>What kind of jobs are you looking for or what is your dream job?</em></strong></p>



<p>After CTD, I plan on becoming a full stack web developer or doing some sort of software development using C#. I would say being a software developer for Google or someplace similar would be pretty cool.</p>
