<p>On Saturday March 9th, high school students from Sampson County Schools Upward Bound participated in Code the Dream’s Hackathon in Durham, NC. Juan Perez, Michael Pineda, Erica Quintana, KeAusja Chestnutt, and Katie Luengas were selected for the Code the Dream Future Scholars Internship. Over the past two the months they built a website with Code the Dream for their organization, <a href="https://ubsampsoncounty.org/">Sampson County Schools Upward Bound</a> using Squarespace. During the Hackathon, these talented students spent several hours throughout the morning and afternoon building two more websites for nonprofits in Sampson County: Rotary Clinton Club and Kiwanis Club of Sampson County. </p>

<p>Rotary Clinton Club is a chapter of Rotary International and Kiwanis Club of Sampson County is chapter Kiwanis International. They learned how to design and style websites throughout the course of their internship. On the day of the Hackathon, they were able to build two websites from scratch in just a few hours! We are so proud of their hard work!  <br></p>

<p></p>



<p>Kelly Garvy, the founder of <a href="https://app.keepupstate.com/">Upstate</a>, wanted to make North Carolina legislation more accessible for everyday citizens, so she created an app with Code the Dream that would accomplish this goal. The goal of Upstate is to help community members track bills by organizing data better and notifying people of changes in a more modern way. The alternative involves looking at the North Carolina General Assembly website<strong> </strong>and manually refreshing the page each time you want to see the changes on bills.</p>



<p>Kelly, originally from Florida, graduated from Notre Dame University in 2010 and studied Environmental Sciences. After her undergraduate studies, she did field research with animal behavior and worked with marine mammals. She got her Master’s in Environmental Management at Duke University in Environmental Economics &amp; Policy and started to get into the policy side of environmental work. After her Master’s, she started doing more research into state policies and realized that it was incredibly difficult for the public to know what was going on. She began meeting with nonprofits, and she saw that nonprofits were also having a hard time tracking policies in the state legislature. The learning curve is really steep for people who want to track bills and there were not many good options for people to follow policy changes. The available tools are really expensive and outdated and there are no public options. In order to combat these obstacles, Kelly created Upstate, which is more modern and has a public option. <br></p>



<p><br></p>



<p>Kelly decided to work with Code the Dream because she did not have any technical experience or a background in tech. The more that she did research on creating a bill tracker, the more she realized that she needed to find someone who had more advanced knowledge on developing apps and websites. She liked the mission of Code the Dream because her company is also mission-based. It was important for her to partner with someone whose mission aligns with her company’s mission. &nbsp;She also loved that Code the Dream teaches people and prioritizes diversity. <em>&nbsp;</em><br></p>



<p>The Code the Dream developers who helped create <a href="https://app.keepupstate.com/">Upstate</a> are Ramiro Rodriguez, Crystal Williams-Brown, and Cruz Nunez. These developers along with Kelly have been developing Upstate over the last year. Upstate checks the legislative website every few minutes and alerts users of updates &nbsp;With Upstate, you can use a smart search bar to find specific bills, committees, and keywords. Additionally, users can search for phrases in bills using a dynamic search bar. Users also can follow those same bills, committees, and keywords and get notifications with <g class="gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="18" data-gr-id="18">text</g> message and email alerts. &nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/tags-1-1.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-1300"/></figure>



<p>For example, if you want to follow Environmental Protection bills, you could follow a keyword like “Environment.” Whenever there is a change to a bill that relates to the Environment, you would get an email or text message about the change. These emails and text messages prevent you from checking the bills all of the time and you would not miss any changes to the bills.</p>

<p>Over the last year, one of the apps Code the Dream has been most proud to develop has been <a href="https://app.keepupstate.com">Upstate</a> &#8212; a tool that allows users to get immediate updates about proposed new state laws in the issue areas they care about most. Yesterday Upstate founder Kelly Garvy and CTD developer Crystal Williams-Brown were on the evening news talking about the app and how they hope it can democratize access to information about important state law decisions.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge and Diana in class.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-222" srcset="https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class.jpg 1000w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class-600x397.jpg 600w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jorge%20and%20Diana%20in%20class-768x508.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>It’s a Thursday night on Fayetteville Street in downtown Raleigh. While many people are drinking and eating their way through downtown, nearly 20 adults and high school students are sitting above the Foundation Bar at the American Underground Campus. These students come from minority, low-income, or immigrant backgrounds. All of them though, share a desire to learn the language of computers in hopes for a career or life change. Their teacher, Ramiro Rodriguez, is leading a conversation that sounds something like: “A equals C and case C is greater than case B.” They’re coding. Code the Dream is their solution, providing an alternative path to success for these students. Unlike careers in education, law, or medicine that require specific degrees, to be a computer programmer, you just need the skills. Originally a pilot project that began in 2015 under local nonprofit Uniting NC, Code the Dream teaches coding to high school students and young adults. Most of the program participants don’t have the means to attend college or are unable to find work. To date, the program has accepted students from more than 20 countries, including Nepal, India, Pakistan, Argentina, and Venezuela, and the in-depth, hands-on curriculum has produced hundreds of capable web and software developers in the Triangle area.</p>



<p>Daisy Magnus-Aryitey, 36, was once one of those students. She moved here from Ghana at age four. After seven years as a stay-at-home mom, Magnus-Aryitey had a hard time navigating the workforce. She joined Code the Dream and remembers not only her own world expanding, but her daughter’s world too. “My daughter always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. I started to learn computer programming and her play shifted from cooking and baking to pretending she had an office with post-it notes and a computer,” she says. Magnus-Aryitey went on to be a full-time software developer at Duke University and is now the director at Code the Dream. She advocates for women, especially mothers and encourages them to consider a career in coding. When she started Code the Dream, it was the first time she remembers feeling comfortable with vulnerability. “As a minority, I had always been scared to be vulnerable. But we were all the same. I just knew it would change my life. There was no looking back,” she says. “The students we get don’t have a lot of resources. They’re willing to work so hard and are totally committed to the program and its mission.”</p>



<p>The program at Code the Dream begins with free coding classes in both Durham and Raleigh, starting with Ruby, where students learn the building blocks of computer programming skills. Students advance to more in-depth classes (Ruby on Rails) where they learn app development, JavaScript, HTML, and user interface. The top-performing students move on to Code the Dream Labs, where they’re paid a stipend to build web applications for local nonprofits and businesses. “It’s a win-win—the students get the experience they can use to launch a new career that’s life-changing for them and their families, and the work they’re doing in many cases benefits our community,” says Dan Rearick, executive director and co-founder of Code the Dream.</p>



<p>Crystal Williams-Brown now works as a full-time intern for Code the Dream Labs. At her high school in New Jersey, it was a big deal for students to graduate. She graduated, and went on to earn both a bachelors and an associate’s degree. Yet she still found it difficult to find a full-time job with decent pay. After joining Code the Dream, she’s transitioned from working at Lowe’s Foods to becoming a skilled coder. Williams-Brown is currently working on an app for Families Together, a local nonprofit that connects homeless people with transportation options. She didn’t think she was smart enough to ever be a coder, but her curiosity got the best of her. “If there’s an interest, take the dive,” she says to anyone who is reluctant to get started in coding. With an interest in gaming and schooling in animation, Williams-Brown took naturally to learning computer technology. “I was most surprised when I did my class; I recognized the logic, of computers. It made sense to me,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Manuel Ramos Gonzalez, 24, came to the U.S. from El Salvador when he was six years old. Due to his dedication to Code the Dream, he’s now in the software engineer apprenticeship at IBM. After finishing high school, Gonzalez planned to enroll in a four-year university. His plans changed as he wasn’t eligible for in-state tuition with his temporary protected status as a citizen (he now has his Green Card). He ended up with an associate’s degree and hoped to continue his education, but couldn’t afford to reconsider a four-year university. Thanks to Code the Dream, he had extensive skills, an impressive portfolio, and a fine-tuned resume which earned him the apprenticeship. “It was really a transformative experience for me,” he says. Fernando Ostoro, 23, is originally from Honduras and says Code the Dream was transformative for him as well. He’s now a software developer at Duke. “I enjoy what I do, it’s taught me a lot about logic. Now I see myself as a more logical person in every aspect of my life.” Ostoro enrolled in Code the Dream courses while getting his associate’s degree at a local community college. Along with another student, he developed an app for Student Action with Farmworkers (SAFW) called Conectate Carolina that helps farmworkers find resources in their area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rearick says that most tech companies today only employee a tiny fraction of black or Latino software developers and engineers. With Code the Dream’s help, however, that is slowly starting to change. “That’s a motivation for what we do. More technology has the possibility to make life better for us,” he says. During the Code the Dream class on Fayetteville Street, Rodriguez, who is a teacher as well as the organization’s co-founder, says something to his students that could simultaneously apply to their lives, not just their programming skills. “There are many different ways to find a solution, sometimes we stumble upon a more complicated one. Trust your gut, it will come with experience.”</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">NC Open Pass is a group that holds open data events with the goal of creating &#8216;civic tech&#8217;. &nbsp;In September, they held their yearly Civic Camp event, where attendees could pitch ideas for civic-minded apps that used open data.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I pitched an idea but my team didn&#8217;t win the final presentation. However, the team that won, NC Clear Path, had an idea similar to ours. The judges encouraged us to work together and the NC Clear Path team was all for it. My idea was an app that shows the accessibility of rest stops and restaurants for travelers with mobility difficulties and encourages users to add details. &nbsp;NC Clear Path had a similar concept but for pedestrians. Their app would use sidewalk data to plan the safest, most practical route for those with mobility difficulties. It would consider elevation, broken sidewalks, curb cuts and the like.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We joined forces to come up with a pitch for All Things Open (a big open data convention full of great workshops). This pitch was a refined version of the NC Open Pass pitch. With our pitch, we painted a clear picture of how our app would meet certain needs and how we would accomplish our goals. After presenting our pitch at All Things Open, we were selected as finalists for Datapalooza.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Datapalooza was intimidating because the other two teams had finished creating their apps and they had gathered user feedback. &nbsp;We had figured out how to get sidewalk data through mapathons and built the basic parts of our app, but we were still having some integration issues. However, in our presentation, we highlighted the open data we used more than the other teams highlighted theirs. I think this helped us win the finals. We won 12 months of co-working space and $5000. I was in shock but I was also very grateful that other people believed in the app as much as I did.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I grew up with people who have mobility issues. I don’t think those issues should stop them from getting where they need to go. Turns out, the judges felt that way too.</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last month, many of the Code the Dream interns attended the <a href="https://allthingsopen.org/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All Things Open</span></a> Conference at the Raleigh Convention Center. &nbsp;All Things Open is the largest open technology event on the East Coast with over 3,500 attendees. Over the course of the 3-day conference, there were more than 200 sessions. These sessions discussed a range of topics that related to Functional Light JavaScript, &nbsp;Application Servers, C# test-driven development, Querying NoSQL with SQL, User Experience (UX), &nbsp;and Visual Validation for Mobile Applications. With these sessions, our interns were able to learn about some of the emerging challenges that are facing coders and how open source technologies can help.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Crystal Williams-Brown raved about the Vue workshop. At first, she was nervous about building something in a framework that she had never used before. However, the Vue Vixens instructors were very encouraging and provided great instructions and handy tools. &nbsp;Another intern, Romina, enjoyed being surrounded by other people that were passionate about coding and building apps and was surprised by the diversity she found. Many of our developers also got a lot out of the Blockchain session. In between going to the different sessions and meeting other developers from across the region, the team also took a moment to step into the All Things Open photo booth. The Code the Dream team had a great time attending All Things Open as can be seen with the photo above!</p>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last week, Code the Dream interns attended the 2018 Call for Code Global Challenge at IBM in RTP.  Call for Code is a multi-year global initiative for developers to use their skills to drive positive change across the world through the code they create. The Call for Code Global Challenge started with 30 teams. IBM and Governor Roy Cooper picked six teams out of the 30 that could help with natural disaster relief efforts. At the Call for Code event, these six teams presented their projects to an audience of IBM employees and nonprofit partners, including Code the Dream. The winners will be announced at the Call for Code Global Prize Celebration on October 29th at the Regency Ballroom in San Francisco.</p>
<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The 2018 Call for Code Global Challenge is the first event run by the Call for Code Global Initiative and this year the theme was Natural Disaster Preparedness and Relief.  This year, developers are challenged to “build solutions that significantly improve the current state of natural disaster preparedness in order to reduce the disruptive impact on human lives, health, and wellbeing.”</p>

<h2>Code the Dream opens doors, launches careers</h2>



<p><strong>By Mandy Mitchell, WRAL reporter &amp; Hannah Webster, WRAL.com editor</strong></p>



<p>DURHAM, N.C.&nbsp;— A Durham startup is making dreams come true for adults and high school students who want to work in technology.</p>



<p>Code the Dream provides free classes for people who are traditionally under-represented in the technology and computer science industries.</p>



<p>Coding was never the kind of work Daisy Magnus-Aryitey imagined herself doing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Three years ago, I was a stay-at-home mom,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>She said she never considered herself to be “good” with computers, but she now has a successful career as a computer programmer.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know that my life changed,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “My family&#8217;s life changed, just to be able to get into this space and to be able to get into something that I never saw myself doing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her life changed thanks to an organization called Code the Dream, a program that gives people from under-represented populations an entry point into the tech industry.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey, who is originally from Ghana, is now the director. &#8220;Our students are usually first-generation Americans, recent immigrants, minorities, women or people from low-income backgrounds,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Most people involved in the program had never seen a line of code before their first class.</p>



<p>Students quickly learn the basics, and within a year, the best students are building their own apps, usually for non-profits in the Triangle.</p>



<p>&#8220;It means the world. Just to have access to the space. Access to the resources, the instructors and getting your foot in the door,&#8221; student Manuel Ramos Gonzalez said.</p>



<p>They are then able to get jobs in technology and coding, industries with increasingly high demands.</p>



<p>“The best part is watching students progress and remembering where they were just a few months ago,” Executive Director Dan Rearick said.</p>



<p>Crystal Williams-Brown was working in a grocery store before she learned about Code the Dream.</p>



<p>She always had an interest in technology but didn&#8217;t think she could pursue a career in the industry.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would love if it could inspire someone who has brushed it off and said that&#8217;s not for me if someone would just see and hear me and just give it a shot,&#8221; Williams-Brown said.</p>



<p>Code the Dream classes, for high school students and young adults, are available year-round.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now with our classes they come in and say oh I am not the only immigrant. I am not the only person of color I am not the only one in this environment,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “That is what makes code the dream so special.&#8221;</p>
