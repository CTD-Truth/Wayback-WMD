<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/"><br>Code the Dream</a> (CTD) is proud to announce Daisy Magnus-Aryitey as the organization’s new Co-Executive Director. Most recently Code the Dream’s Director of Partnerships, Magnus-Aryitey will join Executive Director Dan Rearick in leading day-to-day operations and mapping the path for the fast-growing non-profit.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey is uniquely suited for the position, having been a student in an early version of Code the Dream, co-founding the current incarnation with Dan Rearick and Ramiro Rodriguez, and serving as Director of Programs, Board Vice-Chair, and Director of Partnerships.</p>



<p>“I’m delighted to step into the role of Co-Executive Director,” Magnus-Aryitey said. “This organization, its people and mission, have a special place in my heart. I’m proud of the work that we’ve done thus far, and I’m energized thinking about what’s next.”</p>



<p>A native of Ghana, Magnus-Aryitey moved to the US when she was four and came to North Carolina in 2009. She completed classes in a Code the Dream pilot program, and within a year was working as a full-time software developer at Duke University.</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey is an obvious choice to help lead Code the Dream as it continues to expand and develop, Rearick said.</p>



<p>“From our board and staff to our partners, everyone is excited because of Daisy&#8217;s wisdom and vision, as well as her lived experience that mirrors that of many Code the Dream students,” he said. “Daisy embodies so much of what makes Code the Dream a compelling model and a wonderful community, and it&#8217;s an honor to work alongside her.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>CTD has more than tripled its scope over the last two years, from its start as a grassroots organization serving aspiring programmers and software developers in North Carolina to serving students and communities across the country, from a permanent staff of 4 to a staff of 19, with 34 full time software apprentices. The 39 apps and websites built by CTD Labs now serve marginalized communities around the country.</p>



<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a> envisions a world in which tech innovation comes from all of us and benefits all of us. To that end, the North Carolina-based national nonprofit&#8217;s mission is to create opportunity that changes lives, build technology that benefits communities, and support the diversity that drives a more just and innovative world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Code the Dream works with people from underrepresented backgrounds, including women, people of color, immigrants, and people from low-income communities. Code the Dream is unique in that participants gain real-world experience by building web and mobile technologies that benefit communities in need, then use that experience to launch new careers with life-changing opportunity for themselves and their families.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The six member-owners of <a href="https://www.radiateconsulting.coop/north-carolina-tech-coop">Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina</a> decided that their tech expertise combined with a collective-ownership model was their best route to business ownership and a rewarding career trajectory. After working for months, supported by <a href="https://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a> and the <a href="https://institute.coop/">Democracy at Work Institute</a> (DAWI), they launched the new business at an event on September 2.</p>



<p>“Radiate Consulting North Carolina aims to bring affordable tech-based solutions to a variety of organizations such as non-profits, government and educational agencies, small to medium businesses to name a few, as a means to help them succeed, and grow with the current age of modern technology,” said member-owner Rod Chavez at the launch event. “Radiate aims to help [customers] fill any technological gaps &amp; needs, while empowering our diverse team of member-owners.”</p>



<p>Chavez and Brian Espinosa, both graduates of Code the Dream’s educational programs who went on to be apprentices at <a href="https://codethedream.org/services/">CTD Labs</a>, decided to pursue a cooperative business model in 2020 and started recruiting members in early 2021. They were joined by CTD grads Kevin Arevalo and Sinan Cengiz, as well as Ian Peoples and Guillermo Hernandez Flores to round out a team with a diverse set of complementary skills. All of the founding member-owners are web/mobile application developers and administrators.</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina is the fourth Radiate worker cooperative, and the first to focus on providing tech solutions. As a worker cooperative, the business is both owned and managed by its workers. Together, they ensure fair wages are provided, a healthy work environment is maintained, and—most notably— all Radiate professionals share the profits the business generates.</p>



<p>“There’s a lot of opportunity in the cooperative way that we’re approaching things,” said Espinosa. “Currently we have two major contracts and we’re looking to grow quickly, and to grow together. We have so many strengths among the six of us, and I’m excited about harnessing those to grow this business.”</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina launched with support from <a href="https://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>, a North Carolina-based nonprofit providing high-level software development education to people from diverse low-income backgrounds, and the <a href="https://institute.coop/">Democracy at Work Institute</a>, an organization working to expand worker ownership to reach communities locked out of business ownership opportunities, especially BIPOC, immigrant, and low-wage workers.</p>



<p>“Each year, tens of thousands of university, community college, and advanced degree program students are blocked from working in their chosen fields or obtaining the jobs their skills demand,” said Vanessa Bransburg, managing director at DAWI. “Radiate creates business ownership opportunities for skilled professionals who are facing obstacles like inconsistent contingent work, hiring and workplace discrimination, wage theft, and more.”</p>



<p>In addition to supporting their launch, Code the Dream is Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina’s first client.</p>



<p>“We are happy to see some of our grads go on to such a promising endeavor,” said Code the Dream co-founder Daisy Magnus-Aryitey. “We already have a contract with Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;North Carolina, and we are thrilled to have a chance to continue to work with these motivated, skilled individuals.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Selamawit Shibru joined Code the Dream as an intern in October, 2020. In September, she left after getting a job as a Front End Developer at Tata Consulting Group.</p>



<p><strong>What led to your career in software development?</strong><br>I started developing back home in Ethiopia, where my background is in civil engineering. I got the chance to learn coding during my bachelor’s study. After moving to the US, I joined a non-profit organization in Atlanta named Refcode and worked with them as a volunteer developer and a teaching assistant for students, who take free courses. I got a master’s degree in software development in 2020, just before I got the chance to join Code the Dream for an internship.</p>

<p style="font-size:22px"><strong><strong>What do you like about Code the Dream?</strong><br></strong>The people working here are from different countries, which creates a multicultural environment and diversity of culture. I like that environment.</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p><strong>How did you find out about Code the Dream and why did you want to join?</strong><br>I found out about Code the Dream through Refcode. The founder recommended me to Code the Dream. I love volunteering and working in a multicultural environment.</p>



<p><strong>When did you know you wanted to be a software developer?</strong><br>The first time I fully decided to be a software developer was after I moved to the US and saw that there was a very high demand for developers.</p>



<p><strong>What kinds of work were you doing before Code the Dream?</strong><br>I worked as a cashier full time for over a year before going back to school and then joining Code the Dream.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you move to the US, and when?</strong><br>I came here through the Diversity Visa Lottery in 2018.</p>



<p><strong>What has your experience been like at Code the Dream?</strong><br>For me, Code the Dream is family. We help each other, we share our experiences. Since most of the people are from different countries, it feels like I’m somewhere with my family and friends. Everyone supports us whenever we need help or just have a question during coding. I love working with these people and I’m never scared to ask questions because everyone is so friendly.</p>



<p><strong>What has been your favorite project that you have worked on and why?</strong><br>I’m working on a Falcon project. The reason I like it is because we started it from scratch and it’s an internal project for Code the Dream.</p>



<p><strong>Why is that project meaningful to you?</strong><br>We work as a group, but once it’s done, all of our co-workers will be able to see what we have been working on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What do you want people to know about Code the Dream?</strong><br>When I moved to the US, everything was different. But you will not be scared to make friends at Code the Dream. Everyone is very friendly. I would recommend people to join to experience the friendships, you don’t even feel like you are away from family here.</p>

<p class="has-normal-font-size"><meta charset="utf-8">Hernandez Guzman and Maldonado have been working on the interactive Hill Reading Achievement Program (HillRAP) for CTD Labs’ client the <a href="http://www.hillcenter.org/">Hill Learning Center</a>, a Durham-based learning hub for equitable, research-based, differentiated instruction for students with learning and attention challenges.</p>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>“The data that we get from the HillRAP app helps teachers analyze and maybe have a better understanding of a specific student,” says Maldonado, a Junior Developer at Code the Dream. “It gives real-time feedback and helps teachers to figure out, ‘How can I create a better way to help these specific students?’”</p>



<p>Hernandez Guzman and Maldonado have worked on making the app, previously available only on iPads, a web-based program accessible to anyone with internet access. According to Hernandez Guzman, a Developer and Mentor at CTD, “although it is not exclusively used for remote learning, the necessity of remote learning over the past two school years has deepened the digital divide, and made it more important for programs like this to be available to all, including students, teachers and school districts that can’t afford expensive tablets.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-left is-style-default"><p><strong>I have never seen my students make as much progress or as fast of progress with any other tool. Knowing that my students have access to a program that really works for them no matter the setting we are in has made a big difference in their lives and in ours as the teachers.</strong>&#8220;</p><p></p><cite><p><em>HillRAP user, MS Special Education teacher</em></p></cite></blockquote>



<p>HillRAP is currently being used in 15 states, and five countries. Hill-trained teachers are using HillRAP with over 7000 students with persistent reading difficulties in district, public, charter, independent and non-profit settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing that children are the ultimate beneficiaries of their work is inspiring for Maldonado and Hernandez Guzman. “What I&#8217;m doing with this app is impacting future generations. Every morning when I wake up, I&#8217;m excited because I know I&#8217;m gonna do something great today for others” says Maldonado.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>Every night in bed we read Warrior Kids. My dad reads it to me but sometimes I read it. I tell my dad not to tell me big words and I can sound them out or split them into syllables better!”&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>“I know I am getting better because I like reading with my friends.”</strong></p><p><strong>“When I read the teacher tells me I am doing a good job and getting better. I used to mess up on my words and I don&#8217;t do that as much anymore. Every time I miss a word I know I am going to get it correct someday!”</strong></p><p></p><cite><em>Students using HillRAP</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Code the Dream Executive Director Dan Rearick says that CTD Labs’ work for the Hill Learning Center is a good example of CTD at its best. “We have these skilled, motivated developers who went through our educational program, and they are now getting valuable experience working for a client at CTD Labs,” Rearick says. “And the client provides a service that helps kids and teachers. Ultimately, everyone benefits.”</p>

<p>The member-owners of <a href="https://www.radiateconsulting.coop/north-carolina-tech-coop">Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina</a>, a new tech cooperative founded by six entrepreneurs with a wide range of expertise, will introduce themselves and their business at an online event on Thursday, September 2.</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is a worker-owned and run small business specializing in building high-quality websites and custom web applications that help non-profit organizations, universities, and small businesses meet their tech needs. The founding member-owners are web/mobile application developers and administrators.</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina is the fourth Radiate worker cooperative, and the first to focus on providing tech solutions. As a worker cooperative, the business is both owned and managed by its workers. Together, they ensure fair wages are provided, a healthy work environment is maintained, and—most notably— all Radiate professionals share the profits the business generates.</p>



<p>The business has been launched by Code the Dream in partnership with The Democracy at Work Institute.</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s a lot of opportunity in the cooperative way that we&#8217;re approaching things,” said Member-Owner Brian Espinosa. “Currently we have two major contracts and we’re looking to grow quickly, and to grow together. We have so many strengths among the six of us, and I’m excited about harnessing those to grow this business.”</p>



<p>Radiate Consulting<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> North Carolina launched with support from <a href="https://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>, a North Carolina-based nonprofit providing high-level software development education to people from diverse low-income backgrounds, and the <a href="https://institute.coop/">Democracy at Work Institute</a>, an organization working to expand worker ownership to reach communities locked out of business ownership opportunities, especially BIPOC, immigrant, and low-wage workers..</p>



<p>“We are happy to see some of our grads go on to such a promising endeavor,” said Code the Dream co-founder Daisy Magnus-Aryitey. “We already have a contract with Radiate Consulting North Carolina, and we are thrilled to have a chance to continue to work with these motivated, skilled individuals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the September 2 event, Radiate’s member-owners will introduce their business and themselves, and explain the services they are now offering.</p>



<p>What: Radiate Consulting North Carolina launch event</p>



<p>When: Thursday, September 2, 1pm EST</p>

<p>Quay Weston is a CTD alumni from the 2019 React cohort. He credits his time in the program with “giving me the tools and the language to talk to developers which helped me move into UI/UX design and connected me with other dope people in the tech space.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Community has been the most important part of my professional journey because a lot of the opportunities that I ended up getting I knew nothing about prior to talking to others or someone saying ‘you have these particular skills, I think you’d be great for this.’ That’s been every step of my professional experience.</p></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-7914" srcset="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-300x169.jpg 300w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-768x432.jpg 768w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IMG_6624-960x540.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>Quay shared his story last month during the inaugural Alumni Reunion at American Underground, where students, apprentices, mentors and staff gathered to celebrate the amazing, diverse group of people that make up the Code the Dream community. Diversity is a founding pillar of Code the Dream and the work we do. When asked about it, Quay had this to share:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Diversity in tech looks like folks with different experiences, different backgrounds, various levels of education, people with cognitive differences. The reason why it’s important to me is because for actual change to happen, the kind of transformative change we need in the world, you have to have others with far more imagination and ambition.</p></blockquote>



<p></p>

<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a> (CTD) is happy to announce that Daisy Magnus-Aryitey, co-founder and former board member, has returned to Code the Dream as the first Director of Partnerships.</p>



<p>A native of Ghana, Magnus-Aryitey moved to the US when she was four and came to North Carolina in 2009. She enrolled in an early version of Code the Dream and within a year was working as a full-time software developer at Duke University.</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>After completing the Code the Dream prototype program, Daisy worked with co-founders Dan Rearick and Ramiro Rodriguez to build Code the Dream into its current incarnation, serving as Director of Programs and Board Vice-Chair. In her new role as Director of Partnerships, Magnus-Aryitey will be responsible for creating and cultivating business partnerships that will expand CTD&#8217;s volunteer and mentorship network, website and app projects for Code the Dream&#8217;s in-house software development shop, <a href="https://codethedream.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Copy-of-CTD-v2-new-pics-Trifold-Brochure-8.pdf">CTD Labs</a>, and employment opportunities for CTD apprentices.</p>



<p>“CTD’s mission and values resonate with me on a personal level, particularly their continued commitment to racial and economic justice,” said Magnus-Aryitey. “In my new role, I’ll be focused on creating partnerships with tech companies in the Triangle and across the country.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magnus-Aryitey’s life experience — and her experience with every facet of CTD — make her uniquely qualified for her new position.</p>



<p>“Daisy has always been at the heart of Code the Dream,” said Executive Director Rearick. “While it&#8217;s been great having her on the board, we are thrilled to have her back in our day-to-day leadership — building a more diverse, inclusive economy and technology for a better world.”</p>



<p>Fostering partnerships is particularly important as Code the Dream continues a period of rapid growth — CTD has more than tripled its scope over the last two years, from its start as a grassroots organization serving people in North Carolina to serving students and communities in 12 states, from a permanent staff of 4 to a staff of 17, with 34 full time software apprentices. The 39 apps and websites built by CTD Labs now serve more than two million people.</p>



<p>“Code the Dream is uniquely positioned to support efforts around developing diversity in tech as well as building software that serves the greater good,” said Magnus-Aryitey. “I’m thrilled to be back in this community!”</p>



<p><a href="http://codethedream.org/">Code the Dream </a>is a Durham-based national nonprofit opening career opportunities in tech for people from underrepresented backgrounds, including immigrants &amp; refugees, women, and people of color and from low-income communities. CTD Labs builds socially impactful apps and web technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Magnus-Aryitey shared some of her thoughts on Code the Dream, diversity in tech, and public interest technology in a recent interview in the <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/pit-un/blog/qa-with-daisy-magnus-aryitey-co-founder-of-code-the-dream/">PIT UNiverse newsletter.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In celebration of Pride Month, we are committing to learn even more about how we can create an inclusive, equitable workplace for everyone.</p>



<p>Here are a few resources that we’ve found valuable.</p>



<h2>LGBTQ+ STEM ICONS</h2>



<p>This course from Code Academy offers an opportunity to learn more about important figures in the LGBTQ+ tech community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>These are amazing people who have paved the way for LGBTQ+ inclusivity in tech. Many of their accomplishments in tech affect the technology we use today, and the LGBTQ+ activism they have led has influenced LGBTQ+ acceptance in the modern world.</em></p><cite>&#8211; Code Academy</cite></blockquote>

<h2><strong>TRACKING LGBTQ+ -RELATED LEGISLATION NATIONWIDE</strong></h2>



<p>Legislation is being introduced around the country to limit the rights of Trans people. To understand where and how this legislation is being implemented, follow the Freedom For All Americans and ACLU links below.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>During the 2021 legislative session dozens of states will consider legislation related to LGBTQ discrimination. Some bills will seek to advance the comprehensive nondiscrimination laws that LGBTQ people so sorely need, while others will almost certainly attempt to single out and target LGBTQ people for unfair and unequal treatment. Freedom for All Americans is tracking each relevant bill in our 2021 Legislative Tracker, in partnership with the Equality Federation.</p><cite>&#8211; Freedom for All Americans website</cite></blockquote>

<h2><strong>4 WAYS TO MAKE YOUR WORKPLACE EQUITABLE FOR TRANS PEOPLE</strong></h2>



<p>Creating a safe, inclusive work space is paramount to good company culture. That means investing the necessary time and resources, and being an active listener. This quick piece from NPR gives a few examples on how to begin the process of building that strong company culture.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Even if employers and coworkers genuinely want to be inclusive, they often aren&#8217;t sure where to start. Here are four ways that you can make your workplace — digital or otherwise — more welcoming and equitable for trans people.</p><cite>&#8211; NPR website</cite></blockquote>

<p>Recently, CTD Co-founder and Board Member Daisy Magnus-Aryitey spoke with New America about her origins in technology, her work here at Code the Dream, and why public interest technology is important work for the health and growth of our communities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The potential of technology is colliding at this moment in time with the horrors of technology. We&#8217;re at a point where we realize that the social ills and the social injustices can either be exasperated by tech, or they can be alleviated by technology. We all have to make that intentional decision. Are we going to alleviate these problems with technology?</p></blockquote></figure>
