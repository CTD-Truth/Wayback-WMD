As students transition from basic programing to more in depth app development technologies, it's been inspiring to watch them also develop a keener sense that this could be a real future.</p><p>As Cait recently said, "CTD has been an awesome experience. Ever since beginning the course in October, I find myself looking at web apps and wondering who built them and what languages they used. I try to deconstruct things like user logins and think how I would tackle that part of a project."</p><p>Avi, who is still in high school, said he now plans to study computer science in college, and one day "start up my own business using the skills I have learned." Cait agreed that she was looking forward to "following a new career path that allows me to utilize these new skills.... I can't wait to see what's around the next corner!"</p><p>We can't wait to see it either.</p>

<p><span>Witches, superheroes, and a tarantula - oh my! On Saturday Uniting NC staff and alums from Code the Dream shared coding with children at </span><em>Tech-N-Treat</em><span> in Raleigh, NC. Students went around to different booths to play games while earning stickers for their 'passports' and a few pieces of candy. Code the Dream had two games for the children to play: <a target="_blank" href="http://twolivesleft.com/CargoBot/">Cargo-Bot</a>&nbsp;and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robozzle.com/beta/index.html?puzzle=-1">RoboZZle</a>. Each game had an element of fun but required kids to think like programmers trying to come up with efficient solutions to problems. </span></p><p><span>It was great having CTD alums Katherine and Cynthia share their love for coding with the next generation.

<h3><span>Code the Dream just finished interviews for our Fall 2016 class in Durham, NC! In this application round we received nearly 50 applicants, interviewed 29 individuals, and accepted 16 students for our beginner coding course. &nbsp;</span></h3><h3><span>As a new addition to the staff at Uniting NC, this was my first opportunity to be part of the interviewing team. I greatly enjoyed learning about our applicants’ passions and aspirations for the future. Some want to own their own business or graduate from a 4-year college, but each one has a passion for coding.</span></h3><h3><span>Our course at Code the Dream offers students the ability turn their zeal for technology into a reality by working closely with mentors and creating opportunities to continue their education through advanced classes and practical application of skills. Overall, I am very grateful for everyone who applied for our Fall 2016 class in Durham and cannot wait to see what our current students learn!</span></h3><h3> </h3>]]></description></item><item><title>CtD Lead Instructor Ramiro Rodriguez honored as Tarheel of the Week</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2016 17:11:05 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2016/8/14/ctd-lead-instructor-ramiro-rodriguez-honored-as-tarheel-of-the-week</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:57b0a387cd0f683c60b77849</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Every week the Raleigh News &amp; Observer honors one great North Carolinian as its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article95495282.html">Tarheel of the Week</a>.&nbsp;This week it was our Lead Instructor Ramiro Rodriguez!

<p>BY MARTI MAGUIRE</p><p>RALEIGH</p><p>Daisy Magnus-Aryitey never saw herself as a computer programmer. A native of Ghana who immigrated as a child, she imagined it as a job for men who grew up playing video games.</p><p>“I compared it to playing football,” says the Durham mother of two. “It was out of the realm of possibility.”</p><p>But when she heard about a program that would help her learn coding, she jumped at the chance to find a high-paying job that was also flexible enough for parenting. Just a little over a year later, she’s working in IT for Duke University.</p><p>She credits her teacher, Ramiro Rodriguez, for the fast transformation. He’s the founder and lead teacher of Code the Dream, which aims to steer people from immigrant and minority backgrounds into careers as computer programmers.</p><p>Rodriguez came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, and went on to earn his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science at Cornell University. Since moving to the Triangle a decade ago, he’s co-founded his own technology start-up. Yet over the past two years, he’s still found time to teach and mentor dozens of young people, some of whom have already gone to work as programmers. Most are immigrants, refugees or others who might lack the resources to pay for their education or support their families.</p><p>Read the full story here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article95495282.html">http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article95495282.html</a>.</p><p> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>This is not a drill!</title><dc:creator>Dan Rearick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 19:44:00 +0000</pubDate><link>http://www.codethedream.org/blog/2016/4/26/this-is-not-a-drill</link><guid isPermaLink="false">543d487ae4b0388ca4363b29:5440039de4b0ebb9c704eddc:571fb3d5e707ebe93a864332</guid><description><![CDATA[

<p>Teachers and RTP staff had to prod hundreds of students to get them out the doors, even with the fire alarm going off and the ceiling sprinklers spraying down a few yards away. Some say it all started when overzealous students began 'studying' frisbee flight a little too close to the sprinklers.&nbsp;But whatever the cause,&nbsp;when kids don't want to leave a science event, that's the sign that things were going pretty well!</p><p>The event was put on by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rtp.org/about-us/us2020/">US2020 RTP</a>, a mentorship-based program that aims to inspire young North Carolinians to pursue STEM careers. As a program that recognizes that minority and immigrant youth remain terribly underrepresented in these fields, Code the Dream was happy to be asked to participate.</p><p>Code the Dream Lead Instructor Ramiro Rodriguez brought in an Arduino, an open-source prototyping platform in order to give the kids a taste of how simple code can be used to interact with objects in the "real world." Our team was really impressed with the students' curiosity and desire to understand how things worked.</p><p>And the kids kept coming by the hundreds... right up until the alarm sounded,&nbsp;the sprinklers started spraying, and the lady by the elevators started yelling "This is not a drill!"</p>

<p>On Saturday an enthusiastic group of Code the Dream mentors and students gave up part of their weekend to inspire an even younger generation of future coders and innovators at the first ever Kids Code event at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marbleskidsmuseum.org/">Marbles Kids' Museum</a>.</p>

<p>Cynthia is only 14 herself but already a great student in our current Raleigh CTD class. So it was easy for her to convey to younger children a sense of how 'cool' coding can be and how quickly you can make progress from a young age.&nbsp;</p><p>Francisco noted that the kids who came for the Kids Code event were quite were more diverse than what we see in most tech companies today. One boy even told our students he had been trying out coding since he was 8!</p><p>Thanks so much to the Marbles staff for hosting such a great event. It's interesting to think that we may not see the full benefit of a day like this -- both for the kids and for our whole community -- for years to come. But it seems like a great investment!</p>

<p>Jorge moved to the U.S. from Costa Rica just before high school. He quickly settled in, learned English, and ended up taking AP classes and graduating near the top of his class. &nbsp;But he couldn't find any way that he could afford college.</p><p>Eventually Jorge got an entry level job with a local tech company, and in recent years his responsibilities have grown. Still, he did not have a role in software development, and he knew he had more to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>What Jorge really wanted to do was learn to code. And he took his first steps down that path with Code the Dream last year.</p><p><span>Now after being a star student, Jorge has become the first Code the Dream student to volunteer to take on a teaching role - providing one-on-one help to new students and even teaching entire lessons.</span></p><p><span>Even with all his other responsibilities, Jorge has made time each week to help other young people who were in the same position as he was just a few months earlier. And the students have been very appreciative. While he can't fall back on years of experience, the fact that he started learning so recently means that he knows exactly what they're going through - what's easy and exciting, but more importantly what's likely to be frustrating and confusing. That makes him a great teacher.</span></p><p>You've probably heard the old saying:&nbsp;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.</p><p>But what if that guy who just learned to fish then volunteers to teach others how to fish? Soon enough a whole community is eating a little better, which is pretty awesome. Thanks Jorge!</p>

<p>Beginning last week another talented group of Code the Dream students got to work learning the basics of computer programming.

<p>Students also got an opportunity usually reserved for corporate and other paying clients --&nbsp;to evaluate their own strengths with Raleigh Consulting's George Alwon and Francisco Chavez. It was great to have their expertise and to hear students working through their own goals and possible career paths.</p><p>But probably the most exciting part of the event was hearing more about some great projects that students have been working on -- both paid work that students have gotten since starting Code the Dream and projects they are working on just because they think it could make the world a little better place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A team of eight hardworking Code the Dream students and mentors spent over 20 hours last weekend developing an app to improve internet access for the visually impaired. Their efforts were part of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/triangle/startup-weekend/5951">Startup Weekend</a> event hosted at the <a target="_blank" href="http://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a> in Durham. The team's app, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theblankapp.com">The Blank App</a>, won the&nbsp;weekend-long competition sponsored by <a target="_blank" href="http://connectability.challengepost.com/">AT&amp;T</a> to develop the best app to&nbsp;improve the lives of people living with disabilities.</p><p>We're proud of the team for winning, but of course we're even more excited about the opportunity to make something that stands to improve people's lives.</p><p>A bit more information about our app, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theblankapp.com">The Blank App</a>:</p><iframe scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-GHwqfXXx1c?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" width="854" frameborder="0" height="480">
</iframe><h3>The Problem: Poor Web Accessibility for the Visually Impaired</h3><p>The internet, and all the information, tools and experiences it offers, should be a boon to the visually impaired. It has the potential to bring a hard-to-navigate world to our doorstep. But sadly, much of the internet itself remains very hard to navigate for those who can't see or see well. We need to make it easier to share where the problems are and fix them.</p><p>Visually impaired users are often frustrated by images with no descriptions or fields that cannot be read by their screen reader. There’s usually no easy way to lodge a complaint or to coordinate with others facing the same problem. Even on sites developed by conscientious coders following accessibility norms, it’s easy to miss problems. Hence the need for more feedback directly from visually impaired users.</p><h3>The Solution: Seamless Problem Logging and Automatic Fixes</h3><p>Our team of developers includes visually impaired members who use zoom text and screen readers tools every day.

<p>http://raleigh.quepasanoticias.com/noticias/ciudad/local/52953-ofrecen-cursos-de-programacion-y-desarrollo-de-aplicaciones-a-jovenes</p><h1><strong><span>Programa Code the Dream promueve un mayor acceso de las minorías a la industria tecnológica</span></strong></h1><p><span>Escrito por&nbsp;<a href="http://raleigh.quepasanoticias.com/authors/eloy-tupayachi">Eloy Tupayachi</a></span></p><p>Durham.- Los jóvenes inmigrantes tienen la oportunidad de aprender gratuitamente programación de computadoras y desarrollar aplicaciones para teléfonos móviles mediante el programa<strong>&nbsp;Code the Dream</strong>,&nbsp; un proyecto que busca promover un mayor acceso de las minorías a la industria teconológica.</p><p>El programa empezó en septiembre de 2014 como un proyecto de&nbsp;<strong>Uniting NC</strong>, una organización que ayuda a los inmigrantes a integrarse en Carolina del Norte.&nbsp;<br />Desde entonces, dos grupos de doce estudiantes cada uno han terminado el programa que consiste en seis semanas de clases.</p><p>Dan Rearick, director de Uniting NC y creador del programa, dijo que el objetivo es que más inmigrantes puedan participar de la industria tecnológica como lo hacen en otros sectores.</p><p><em>“Los inmigrantes montan negocios a una tasa que es dos veces más que el resto de nosotros que nacimos en los Estados Unidos y más del 40% de las compañías Fortune 500 fueron montadas por inmigrantes de primera generación o por sus hijos”</em>, dijo Rearick a&nbsp;<strong>Qué Pasa.</strong></p><p><em>“Es una cifra muy asombrosa. Pero no lo es cuando piensas en todo lo que esta gente ha pasado, lo que ha dejado y los riesgos que estuvieron dispuestos a tomar”</em>, añadió Rearick.</p><p>Ramiro Rodríguez, uno de los profesores voluntarios de&nbsp;<strong>Code The Dream</strong>&nbsp;e inmigrante mexicano, cree en el potencial de las minorías en el campo tecnológico.</p><p><em>“No importa quién es, si es una mujer, un afroamericano o quien sea. Es posible para todos nosotros aprender”</em>, dijo Rodríguez.</p><p>Una vez que los estudiantes completan las clases con&nbsp;<strong>Code The Dream</strong>, pueden asistir a The Iron Yard, una academia de programación que dura tres meses, o quedarse en el programa para seguir trabajando en sus propias aplicaciones.</p>

<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1433082595829_24781">Rubén Cruz, un alumno en la primera clase, dijo que el curso cambió la dirección de su vida.</p><p><em>“Antes de Code the Dream, estaba en un colegio comunitario. No sabía si ir a una universidad era una opción para mi”</em>, dijo Cruz, cuyos padres emigaron desde México.</p><p><em>“Al final decidí que esto es algo que me gustaría hacer. Esta es una carrera que yo quiero seguir”</em>, agregó Cruz quien continúa estudiando la programación en la academia The Iron Yard.</p><p>Aunque no todos los alumnos que completan el programa siguen estudiando programación, utilizan las habilidades aprendidas en distintas carreras.</p><p>Carla Mena, una alumna de origen peruano que trabaja con Rubén para crear una aplicación que se llama Pinteresting, dijo que aplica lo que aprendió en su trabajo para el Instituto de la Salud Global de Duke.</p><p><em>“El programa en que yo estoy trabajado usa aplicaciones móviles y ahora yo estoy ayudando a resolver algunos de los problemas”</em>, dijo Mena.</p><p><strong>El próximo curso de Code The Dream se ofrecerá en junio en Durham</strong>&nbsp;y está dirigido principalmente a jóvenes inmigrantes.

In what's known as the Research Triangle - an area that includes all three cities - the entrepreneurial ecosystem has become a laboratory working to address some of America's great challenges.</p><p>Racial and gender inclusion? We're working on it. A creative AND affordable quality of life?<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.forbes.com/places/nc/raleigh/">&nbsp;It's happening.</a>&nbsp;A common cause across generations? Without it, we wouldn't be here at all. It's not that the&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/lifestyle/which-is-americas-best-city-09202011.html">Research Triangle has the answers</a>. But a confluence of assets, people and ideas -- and a drive to succeed -- has put in place the tools to experiment.</p><p>When Steve Case brings his&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://riseofrest.com/">Rise of the Rest tour here on May 5</a>, he'll find not just startup founders standing in line to pitch their 'eureka' moments, but a community eager to share the business and cultural map we're drawing together. Here's a look at three key points on the map:</p><p><strong>Generations Joined:&nbsp;</strong>Much has been written about millennials' quest to find their footing. In the Research Triangle, many have embraced a regional legacy -- but added a new twist. Previous generations founded three world-caliber research universities here -- Duke, NC State, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill -- as well as the vast Research Triangle Park, home to pharma and tech giants from GSK to Red Hat and IBM.</p><p>To this tradition, 20 and 30 somethings contributed a crucial new layer: startup hubs and incubators, designed in part to retain the talent coming out of our universities and transform research into companies, jobs, opportunity. A symbiotic relationship soon took flight. For example, the&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a>&nbsp;-- a Google for Entrepreneurs tech hub and home to&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://americanunderground.com/">back-to-back Google Demo Day winners</a>&nbsp;-- features the support of all three universities and the governing body of the Research Triangle Park, which recently added its own entrepreneurial hub.</p><p>Here, generations frequently link arms, with quantifiable results. At the&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="https://americantobaccocampus.com/">American Tobacco Campus tech hub</a>&nbsp;-- developed through a partnership of longtime community pillars -- six young companies have made exits within the last 24 months amounting to&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://americanunderground.com/1-billion-6-exits-24-mos-durham-nc/">more than $1 billion</a>&nbsp;in stock and cash.</p><p><strong>Inclusive:&nbsp;</strong>America's demographics are fundamentally changing.&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/cspan/pop_proj/20121214_cspan_popproj.pdf">By the year 2043, the current minority population is forecast to be the majority population</a>. In the Triangle, we see a major opportunity building. We're working aggressively to build an inclusive ecosystem from the start, rather than repair deficiencies after it's built.</p><p>A program launched by Uniting NC,&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.codethedream.org/">Code the Dream</a>, is teaching young members of our immigrant community the basics of Ruby on Rails to begin a pathway into some of the Triangle's high-paying developer jobs. Last month, the American Underground partnered with San Francisco-based CODE2040 and Google for Entrepreneurs to bring aboard an Entrepreneur in Residence, Talib Graves-Manns of&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://rainbowmekids.com/">RainbowMe</a>, to support minority led startups while building his own business.</p><p>At the front end, the team at the Durham Innovation District (which hosts Duke University researchers in downtown labs) recently donated $250,000 to a program identifying and training a diverse assortment of budding science and tech leaders before they hit high school. Further in the process,&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://soartriangle.co/">Soar Triangle</a>&nbsp;and e51 provide mentoring, access to capital networks, and more, with the goal of scaling more and better-funded female led teams in the Triangle.</p><p>By cultivating diverse leaders and technology companies, these businesses will have a fundamental advantage in serving a more diverse economy and world. That means new jobs and opportunities, which feed into our next big issue.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong>&nbsp;Increasingly, Americans long for both urban amenities and the opportunity for more people to share in them.&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.today.com/money/best-cheap-cities-raising-family-2D79535619">The cost of living in the Triangle is much lower</a>&nbsp;than in other tech metros. This natural advantage has become a key starting point for building a thriving and inclusive community that encourages creativity and enterprise.</p><p>New housing is popping up in city centers here at a healthy variety of price points. In downtown Raleigh, entrepreneurs can live in&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.thinkhouse.us/">ThinkHouse</a>, a 24/7 dorm for startups, and mix with people from every corner of the city at&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://www.sparkcon.com/">SPARKcon</a>, an annual, grassroots arts and innovation festival. In downtown Durham, you can live on a modest budget in the historic and revitalized&nbsp;<a target="_hplink" href="http://durhamnc.gov/ich/cb/cdd/Pages/ssd_revit.aspx">Southside</a>&nbsp;neighborhood and bike to three major tech hubs and a minor league baseball stadium.</p><p>All over, bike lanes and greenways are unfurling, often driven by the organized advocacy of young entrepreneurs. And while our public conversation about mass transit continues to be noisy, that's only because it includes a symphony of voices.</p><p>Do we have all the answers? Not even close. Are we asking the right questions? We think so. The Triangle is purposefully working to deal with the hard stuff we know and that which may come. Hard stuff is what entrepreneurialism is all about. It's about diligently working to create something better, just as the Rise of the Rest tour is doing.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
